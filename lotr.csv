2021-02-02 07:54:30,lotr,"We only have this description from *Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age* from ***The Silmarillion***:

>*It is said that the host that was there assembled was fairer and more splendid in arms than any that has since been seen in Middle-earth,* ***and none greater has been mustered since the host of the Valar went against Thangorodrim.***

As you can see, no specific numbers.

But it was bigger than War of the Ring battles."
2021-02-02 07:50:43,lotr,They're done after the hobbit. Forget it. There will never be another good screen adaptation.
2021-02-02 07:50:12,lotr,Will do! Thanks for the tip:)
2021-02-02 07:48:34,lotr,Awesome
2021-02-02 07:48:26,lotr,Who is the character to the left of the fellowship?
2021-02-02 07:47:56,lotr,Begging your pardon Mr Frodo but right now there's a discount on VPN services--ifn' you please.
2021-02-02 07:47:47,lotr, **Namárië!**
2021-02-02 07:45:00,lotr,This is great! You should crosspost to /r/booknooks!
2021-02-02 07:36:42,lotr,It was funny when this went viral on Twitter a couple days ago.

2021-02-02 07:26:24,lotr,"The unfortunate thing is that Tolkien rarely gave army sizes. 

If we're talking exclusively Third Age, then the Battle of Fornost was probably the largest. Gondor's army was said to be so large that they struggled to fit all of their ships into the harbours of Mithlond, Forlond and Harlond, and that the Men of Arnor and the Elves were in awe. It's also said that it was only a small part of Gondor's power, and this is when Gondor had already been in decline for 500 years. Gondor's earlier battles in the Third Age against the Haradrim and the Easterlings would also have been quite large. 

The thing is that the battles of the Third Age were dwarfed by the battles of the First Age and the Second Age. The War of Wrah at the end of the First Age was so large that it lasted the better part of fifty years."
2021-02-02 07:22:41,lotr,Nice.
2021-02-02 07:21:07,lotr,This is so beautiful!
2021-02-02 07:20:38,lotr," First Age > everything else.

Granted, the Numenorian Armada that captured Sauron in the Second Age could probably give those First Age armies a run for their money, as it was so large and powerful that Sauron did not even think it was worthwhile to offer battle."
2021-02-02 07:17:02,lotr,You my friend bow to no one
2021-02-02 07:14:54,lotr,"Damn, out of curiosity what are the biggest battles in terms of army size?"
2021-02-02 07:12:54,lotr,"Broo, all greetings, I'm feelin this one"
2021-02-02 07:12:09,lotr,"Almost certainly the Battle of Dagorlad. 

Dagorlad involved six separate armies on the side of the Free Peoples: Gondor, Arnor, Lindon, Lorinand, Greenwood and Khazad-dum. Sauron's forces are unknown, but despite his defeat at Dagorlad, he was still able to hold out for an extra seven years in Barad-dur. 

The Battle of Pelennor Fields lasted a single day. Only two armies participated on the side of the Free Peoples: Gondor (~10,000+) and Rohan (6,000). Sauron had multiple armies fight beneath him, but only the number of Haradrim are known (18,000). But it's unlikely Sauron's total forces were larger than 100,000. 

The Battle of Pelennor Fields may have been one of the most important battles of the Third Age, but it probably didn't even crack the top ten in terms of size."
2021-02-02 07:12:00,lotr,"The grey company were so BA! I just finished that part for my first time (first read through, had the book for 20 years lol). Aragorn’s homies"
2021-02-02 07:10:59,lotr,">Aragorn solo them while 4 daggers that were designed to kill them were lying around. While Frodo shouted the name of Varda Elbereth Queen of Stars from deepest of his heart. While he was wielding a torch.

I am just learning this quite nice detail. I guess there is always something to discover in lotr universe."
2021-02-02 07:08:37,lotr,This is so beautiful...
2021-02-02 07:06:08,lotr,Oh really?
2021-02-02 07:00:53,lotr,"Aragorn didn't solo several Ringwraiths.  

The Ringwraiths were surprised and confused at the resolve of both Frodo and Aragron.  

They retreated, after having stabbed Frodo, thinking there was no need for them to fight.

\>Why was the prophecy that no man can kill the witch king? 

The prophecy isn't necessarily what *must* happen, just what *will* happen."
2021-02-02 06:59:18,lotr,"Nah, they just didn’t need to stick around. They’d stabbed Frodo and Aragorn was starting to inconvenience them and they could easily catch the ring later."
2021-02-02 06:56:43,lotr,Galadriel Gandalf Aragorn Elrond Glorfindel Cirdan and probably Celeborn
2021-02-02 06:53:56,lotr,"I wasn't even talking about Quenta Silmarillion. 

in the Unfinished Tales or in LotR appendices Tolkien should've explicitly stated that Galadriel invented these things for Lorien. 

He turned Galadriel into a warrior one year before he dies. Don't tell me he haven't had enough time to include her in War of the Elves vs Sauron.

Lmao we don't even know who was the founder of Eregion. And this is very important in Galadriel's history. And it would be completely in conflict with her motivations if she wasn't the founder of Eregion. Tolkien just messed up in writing one of his most important characters.

""These two kinsfolk (Fëanor and Galadriel), the greatest of the Eldar in Valinor, were unfriends for ever."" ""Who together with the greatest of all the Eldar, Luthien Tinuviel, daughter of Elu Thingol, are the chief matter of the legends and histories of the Elves.""

I'm sorry professor, not enough explicit evidence and text and stories to prove your claim about Galadriel. We can believe your claims about Feanor and Luthien though, because you wrote those characters so well, unlike how you wrote Galadriel."
2021-02-02 06:52:57,lotr,I have the 50th edition. It has a nice very large foldout map inside the front cover.
2021-02-02 06:44:15,lotr,"I always thought of it as just cheekiness. Glorfindel was being cheeky when he said ""no mortal man can kill him"" after he lost the chance to kill him. The Witch-king was being tongue and cheek quoting Glorfindel. Eowin was being snarky and a bit too literal. Every other jerk in Middle Earth called it a prophecy. So, yea, Aragon would lay a beatdown on that sassy old man."
2021-02-02 06:44:12,lotr,"If you have a leg amputated your leg heals, but is it the same afterward? 

The Valar are angels, not gods. They have great powers, but they aren't all-powerful or even all-knowing. They couldn't put things back to the way they were even if they tried to. And besides, it's a better idea to teach Men and Elves to cooperate so they can recognize and defeat evil on their own. If the Valar stepped in every time there was a problem, they would end up having to solve *every* problem forever."
2021-02-02 06:42:37,lotr,I don't care WHO is under that hat!  They aren't allowed at MY house!
2021-02-02 06:40:58,lotr,"Well, the problem is that Galadriel is a late addition to the legendarium, one who arose in  LOTR and then Tolkien had to retcon the first age stories to fit her in, a process he didn't do very well.

So what we're left with are statements about how she is the overall most-est (beautiful, talented, wisest, etc) but with no concrete evidence of her actually doing anything. But damnably to me, she doesn't really have much in the way of flaws to actually make her interesting. The earliest conceptions of her are the most intriguing to me, but with each later tweak she becomes too perfect and something of a Mary Sue."
2021-02-02 06:39:28,lotr,Oh wow I forgot about this game...
2021-02-02 06:37:21,lotr,"That is not how power works within Tolkien's world. Aragorn is not a level 9 Ranger, Nazgul are not leveled between 15 - 21, Gandalf is not a level 24 Wizard, who then ""levels up"" to 27.

Consider that Sauron is probably the most powerful being within the confines of the world at the end of the Third Age, yet at his peak at the end of the Second Age with the Ring he was still defeated in armed combat by a man and an elf (Gil-Galad and Elendil) though those two died in the battle, or at least that is how it went down in the books.

Most manifestations of *Power* within Tolkien's world are influence over the minds and attitudes of others. For example, the primary power of the Nazgul is the aura of creeping dread and terror they produce. At the Battle of the Pellenor, the Nazgul incapacitate a significant amount of the garrison at Minas Tirith through fear alone, rendering them incapable of fighting. Gandalf is working to counteract that spell."
2021-02-02 06:34:16,lotr,"ok, thanks for the detailed answer, that answers my question perfectly. Hypothetically speaking, just on power levels, who during the war of the ring, would have a higher power level than the powered up witch king?"
2021-02-02 06:31:55,lotr,The Silmarillion was never finished or intended for publication. You are literally criticizing notes for a character's backstory and insulting the author over something they never intended to publish.
2021-02-02 06:31:29,lotr,"Aragorn solo them while 4 daggers that were designed to kill them were lying around. While Frodo shouted the name of Varda Elbereth Queen of Stars from deepest of his heart. While he was wielding a torch. 

He did not fight them in the books. He merely scared them thanks to help of Frodo and the daggers lying around. Their purpose was done. They stabbed Frodo and Frodo was going to turn into a Ring-Wraith. The Nazgul's job was done there. They fled.

The Witch-King in RotK was empowered by Sauron. He was far more deadly than FotR Witch-King. 

Aragorn could not kill the Witch-King because Fate would prevent him. Something would've always happened that he would fail to kill the Witch-King. Witch-King was fated to die by the hands of a non-man. 

Your question is like, could Morgoth kill Huan? No something would've happened so Huan wouldn't get killed by Morgoth. Huan was fated to die by the hands and jaws of the deadliest wolf of all times."
2021-02-02 06:30:47,lotr,[removed]
2021-02-02 06:29:43,lotr,"I know aragon didnt kill any, he just drove them off but even having the ability to drive them off imo shows that he has the skill to kill them, or else they would have stayed"
2021-02-02 06:27:32,lotr,"I also heard that the witch king was closer to Gandalf's level, so how could Aragorn have even fought off several of them including the witch king?"
2021-02-02 06:26:49,lotr,"Aragorn never killed any wraiths as far as I remember- he fought some off on weathertop, but didn’t kill any. I don’t think even Gandalf killed any, and he’s Gandalf."
2021-02-02 06:25:22,lotr,"It wasn't that he was incapable due to his lack of skills or ability, but that he couldn't exactly because its a prophecy. Things that are prophetic/dooms are more powerful than character agency in Tolkien mythology."
2021-02-02 06:20:36,lotr,Hama also interacts with the inside of a warg's mouth
2021-02-02 06:15:09,lotr,[removed]
2021-02-02 06:14:08,lotr,"For 8000 years she did not show any sign of great wisdom until in WotR she suddenly became the wisest Elf. 

We don't even know if she was the actual person who made Silvan grow in wisdom. Maybe Amdir and Amroth and Celeborn were the actual guys who made Silvan into some of the greatest Elves. All Tolkien ever said was : under the leadership of these people (Amdir and Amroth and Celeborn and Galadriel) Silvan became ordered folk and grew in wisdom. 

Did Galadriel teach them how to bake Lembas, how to craft awesome bows etc? Did Galadriel create the Fountain and the Mirror and the Phial etc? We don't know. Tolkien never mentioned these. Maybe Amdir's wife was also a pupil of Melian, and she was the actual woman who taught Silvan how to bake Lembas. Maybe Amdir or Amroth had a thing for swans and they demanded their Noldor and Dwarf friends to make them a Fountain in shape of a swan and then one of the Smiths of Eregion who migrated to Lothlorien, used the Fountain to capture the Light of the Silmaril into a Phial. This is as valid as saying Galadriel did all these things; because Tolkien never explicitly stated who did them.

Galadriel was a useless scum for 8000 years until in WotR she suddenly became the hero of Middle-earth."
2021-02-02 06:13:32,lotr,"It's not official, but you can vote on lego site for it"
2021-02-02 06:13:31,lotr,This is such a good idea!
2021-02-02 06:11:09,lotr,"Yeah, I caught that as well, because I think the Orcish language or Uruk-Hai language, I believe is adapted Elvish?"
2021-02-02 06:08:55,lotr,Hobbit then Lord of the Rings personally tho I would tell y’all to read them
2021-02-02 06:02:06,lotr,"My favourite chapter as well! Love this, you’re very talented :)"
2021-02-02 05:57:42,lotr,"You are undervaluing her feats that he did write about simply because they weren't physical. Her greatest strengths are wisdom, resolve, kindness, etc. The fellowship would not have succeeded without her guidance and foresight. She was done fighting by that time. True strength doesn't come by being a warrior, but by preserving peace and goodness."
2021-02-02 05:55:46,lotr,"So like you said Hama stopped him physically from intervening with the Edoras brawl. Hama can't be a figment of Theoden's mind since he interacts with the leftover fellowship. Aragorn also orders Gamling to take the women and the children to the caves I believe. And in The Return of the King Theoden sends Gamling to gather the troops to Dunharrow and ends up eating a meal with Eomer. Theoden is not there. 

As a side contradiction Gamling's iteration in the movies is much different from the books since in Jackson's trilogy Gamling took on aspects of roles of a couple characters in the books. Now I haven't watched the movies since quarantining last summer and read the books in maybe the last two or three years but I believe Gamling to be a real boy..... like Pinocchio."
2021-02-02 05:53:18,lotr,"And it seams to effect Elrond and Legolas more.
Or do they just look disappointed for a second?"
2021-02-02 05:51:04,lotr,Great! Could you incorporate some of the pieces of the sword of Andúril? (As represented in the movie) It would give the pieces more meaning.
2021-02-02 05:49:35,lotr,I want this so badly
2021-02-02 05:46:28,lotr,Wow.
2021-02-02 05:44:46,lotr,"> lIf Elves could fly over mountains, they might fetch the Sun to save us,” answered Gandalf. “But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.”"
2021-02-02 05:44:11,lotr,This is a cool theory for the movie but in the book he does talk to other characters.
2021-02-02 05:44:00,lotr,"I don’t think Rowling ripped Tolkien off, but it’s not the same. Silmarillion was relatively recent and still copyrighted, Rowling claims she never read Tolkien’s works? The myths are ancient and elements can be seen in almost all stories, Tolkien was always open about how and where they inspired him."
2021-02-02 05:41:42,lotr,"I really can't think of any similarities between Harry Potter and the Silmarillion. Can you give an example? I personally doubt she's even read it. 

The idea of a horcrux goes back to 1001 Arabian Nights, much of her content was inspired by Arthurian Legend and British folk tales (which also inspired Tolkien). Every fantasy writer owes something to Tolkien, but Harry Potter is not particularly similar."
2021-02-02 05:40:27,lotr,Thanks! It’s my first project in a while and I was pretty rusty - luckily I made the wise decision to paint the figures in the background first lol
2021-02-02 05:39:58,lotr,S.R. 1 is the same as T.A. 1601. The Third Age ends in T.A. 3021 so S.R. 2000 would be F.A. 578 I believe.
2021-02-02 05:32:21,lotr,thats what everyone says isnt it?
2021-02-02 05:31:13,lotr,"That's cool, amazing!"

2021-02-02 05:27:32,lotr,"Oh right, I think I was persuaded by Sauron like the Numenorians lol"
2021-02-02 05:26:53,lotr,well for example if we are living in 2000 S.R. what is the year in the age system?
2021-02-02 05:26:14,lotr,"No, he will still die in the normal fashion. The Undying Lands are called that because they are home to the Undying, not because they MAKE you undying. All mortals are still mortal."
2021-02-02 05:24:43,lotr,Is your gripe that an author decided to not write extensive back stories for every character explaining his/her each and every feat?
2021-02-02 05:24:30,lotr,"The “Age” system was created by the Elves, which is why the Ages end only with things that are important to THEM (overthrow of Sauron, departure of the Wise) rather than to other peoples (Downfall of Numenor, return of the King). The Dunedain are Elf-friends and just followed their system, as did the Men who were ruled by the Dunedain.

The Hobbits have their own calendar system anyway, called Shire Reckoning (S.R.). This begins with the founding of the Shire."

2021-02-02 05:24:02,lotr,"Thanks for the reply, I really appreciate it. So, how do you think a fight between Dain and Azaghal would go? I know they have pretty uncomparable feats, but who do you think has a better chance?

Also, how do you think a film battle between Dain and Thorin would go?"
2021-02-02 05:23:17,lotr,Already did

2021-02-02 05:07:39,lotr,"You can tell there is something behind the screen every time you see a LOTR movie. You dont see this in any movie, this is what really make this movies the master piece they are. Thank you Pete."
2021-02-02 05:07:22,lotr,"No, your right. There hasn’t been an original thought since The Odyssey. I’ll definitely check out the two things you mentioned. I know Tolkien took a lot from mythology and a few other places, but I’ve never heard of Wolfings or the Ring Cycle. 

I think it’s one thing to be inspired by something, but something different to copy it completely. It’s like when, instead of doing your own work, you copy someone’s homework and write it just a *tiny* bit differently so no one can tell that you cheated, you know?"
2021-02-02 05:05:43,lotr,"LOTR first, since its way better."

2021-02-02 04:44:59,lotr,Completely agree
2021-02-02 04:42:48,lotr,"Not just literature. All of art. It's not a rip off to be inspired by something. You should look up how much stuff Tolkien lifted from the House of the Wolfings series by William Morris. The name Shadowfax was taken from it as well as the plot line of Luthien Tinuviel's maia mother. It was one of Tolkien's favorites although it was not very popular. You should also read about Wagner's ring cycle, the ring of Gyges, etc. The name Gandalf and all the names of the dwarves in The Hobbit appear exactly as they are in an old Norse story (Gandalf is one of the dwarves). 

The two most original things Tolkien did were inventing his languages as part of his world building and the invention of Hobbits."
2021-02-02 04:37:55,lotr,Really too bad they didn't make an appearance in the movies. Would have been cool to see more of the Dunedain.
