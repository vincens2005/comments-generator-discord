2021-02-03 11:17:32,tifu,I'm convinced people actually get less mature as we age.
2021-02-03 11:17:23,tifu,Same! He was surely in freak out mode. Note to self: do not consult Dr. Google.
2021-02-03 11:16:03,tifu," Yo

2021-02-03 11:15:59,tifu,I can firmly say as a gay guy we don’t want misogynists on our team. Maybe try being an asexual.
2021-02-03 11:15:46,tifu,Sounds like he needs a poop knife.  It is a thing.
2021-02-03 11:15:45,tifu,People are obviously reading three lines of this then down voting..... READ DA WHOLE THANG!

2021-02-03 11:15:05,tifu,"I haven’t heard of butcher box before, but Blackwing is kind of like the Whole Foods of online food shopping, obviously with the exception of the fact that Whole Foods is a grocery store with practically everything and Blackwing is mostly just meat. The quality is excellent, my mom and I have used it for years. It definitely focuses on humane farming practices, grass-fed, non preservatives, and they even have Kobe beef. It does come in a box frozen with dry ice, so you know they really want to make sure you won’t have a bad day over foul meat just because of temperature. Obviously used it has plenty of options, I found everything I needed."
2021-02-03 11:14:58,tifu,"Sorry to hear that m8. I fucking *wish* I was gay! Women are fucking insane. See: the $1k I dropped on a new windshield last winter because I told a girl fucking someone while you are not dating each other, and have not spoken to each other for over a month, and have no intention of getting back together with (regardless of whether or not you end up getting back together with one another at a later date), is not in fact the same thing as fucking someone while you're dating. Wasn't even rude about it. I'd say like... 70% of women are fucking nuts once you've been hanging out with them for like a couple weeks or so man, bullet dodged."
2021-02-03 11:14:14,tifu,As a dude that feels all handshakes and half brugs are always awkward I think you're over thinking it.
2021-02-03 11:13:55,tifu,"Gonna be a gift basket. Toilet paper, poo-pouri, poop knife, wet naps, spray bottle, you know. The essentials."
2021-02-03 11:13:51,tifu,What the hell did y'all eat!
2021-02-03 11:13:50,tifu,I think this is hilarious

2021-02-02 08:02:34,tifu,"Don’t ever comment on someone’s weight unless you’re extremely close (family, SO, best friend) and you have a specific reason to feel concerned. Then you’d maybe set aside some time for a heart to heart telling them gently that you are concerned for their physical/mental health or to ask them if everything is okay. Someone might see this and say that “you should never bring it up no matter what”, but I personally feel if you see a change in someone’s behavior or appearance that leads you to worry whether they are dealing with something negative/intense it’s okay to show concern in the appropriate setting."
2021-02-02 08:02:25,tifu,"It can be very hurtful to tell a very small person they need to gain weight.... you never know what eating disorders, health concerns, or just genetics are at play. 

I would really recommend that even if you believe weight is a choice, treat it like it isn’t, and don’t comment unless the other person brings it up first."
2021-02-02 08:02:01,tifu,"Yeah, that's a good one, I'll keep that one in mind"

2021-02-02 08:01:23,tifu,Consoles from Sony are just as 'out of stock' as other retailers.
2021-02-02 08:01:13,tifu,I swear I've read this before... if not I'm having a major case of deja vu.
2021-02-02 08:01:01,tifu,I'm aware. The compliments are more for progressive weight loss you'd see over months.
2021-02-02 08:00:51,tifu,"Sorry, my account was hacked."
2021-02-02 08:00:42,tifu,I like how your typo shows how unessary some letters are in some words

2021-02-02 07:59:33,tifu,But that's still a compliment
2021-02-02 07:59:19,tifu,Unless they mean fat in eating a lot. That's the only time it's not objective and more so used loosely.
2021-02-02 07:59:17,tifu,"life pro-est tip:  Lighten up, francis.  Mild social faux paus should not impact either party for more than a few minutes.  If you are losing sleep over this how in the holy hell do you manage actual life?"
2021-02-02 07:59:15,tifu,"Keep in mind weight loss is not always positive, and if it’s very sudden, it’s probably not. Cancer and other serious illnesses tend to cause massive weight loss."
2021-02-02 07:59:07,tifu,I don’t know why someone wakes up and sees someone’s weight and decides they have to comment on it. Who are you to comment on that.
2021-02-02 07:59:00,tifu,"My mom was my companion for my hospital admission and he was regularly updating her on my condition via call since he carried out the procedure himself. It's just that he only entered the theatre after I was fully sedated. And maybe he chose to limit unwanted contact due to COVID, but that's just my wild guess."
2021-02-02 07:58:54,tifu,LOL. I wasn’t “all upset” about you posting facts. I wasn’t upset period. You came at the OP and subject matter of hand soap aggressively. That’s what brings the fun upbeat vibe down. And that’s a fact.
2021-02-02 07:58:51,tifu,"Ugh, recently I saw a regular at my work I hadn’t seen since January of 2020 when I ran into them during an EXTREMELY vulnerable time for me where I weighed about 20 pounds more than I do now. I personally don’t generally think much about my weight, I do fluctuate seasonally just based on physical activity.


Anyway, last time she saw me I was borderline suicidal and just really in rough shape. I’m currently on anti-depressants that work but I have *no* appetite. None. I sometimes go an entire day without eating before I even notice. It’s not great, and it’s something I’m working on, but I have, I suppose, lost weight due to this unhealthy habit I have inadvertently developed.


She looked at me and said, “Holy shit I almost didn’t recognize you, you’ve lost SO MUCH WEIGHT.” That was almost two weeks ago and I haven’t stopped being freaked out by my body since. The fact that she thought it was acceptable to comment on my body like that makes me so uncomfortable. I wish she had not said anything at all."
2021-02-02 07:58:32,tifu,"""Whoops commented on the wrong picture"" then rewrite the comment on the new one"
2021-02-02 07:58:30,tifu,"9000 comments saying “you should never... blah blah blah”.

How about you should never comment until you’ve read a few comments and seen that what you were going to say has already been said a billion times."
2021-02-02 07:58:12,tifu,"Oh kid, I know you posted this to be funny, and I know I'm going to have people jumping on me for judging, but ... if you're that addicted to hentai to the point where you have a whole separate laptop for saved hentai, please know that porn addiction is a real thing.  You're what, in high school?  This is the time to meet real women and learn how to make friends with both guys and girls. Hentai can mess with your ability to talk to women in real life.  If you ever get the feeling that you're watching a bit too much porn, check out r/pornaddiction.  Nothing wrong with some hentai once in a while, but if you've got a whole laptop full of it you might want to consider where you want your life to be in 5 years."
2021-02-02 07:58:02,tifu,It is. I was just noting the person said comment on something they can control as if weight in most cases isn't controllable.
2021-02-02 07:58:00,tifu,"Why would you even do that, even if she has lost the weight, still comparing and commenting ain't cool at all! Respect all body types!"
2021-02-02 07:57:44,tifu,"Have a silver award, ignorance deserves useless accolade"
2021-02-02 07:57:42,tifu,Weight and trauma are related.  Tread carefully
2021-02-02 07:57:19,tifu,"Weight does not correlate completely or 100% equally to health and fitness. I'm currently overweight for my height and based on BMI. (Ugh BMI) because I had a baby four months ago. However my cholesterol is stellar and I have no blood pressure issues etc...some strong indicators of health. I can also hike 4-5 miles every weekend and just started jogging again. I also exercised through my entire pregnancy even though I gained like 40lbs. So as I see it I am healthy. I don't have any chronic health conditions, I'm strong and fairly fit even though yes I am considered overweight."
2021-02-02 07:57:03,tifu,"Right??! These people with their backhanded “compliments”. OP didn’t fuck up because they missed a TBT, they fucked up by making these types of comments in the first place. Keep ya damn opinion to yaself ✋"
2021-02-02 07:56:57,tifu,I was in the first month of a new relationship and she mentioned that her ex used to ass fuck her. I thought she was over sharing. Then a week later she mentioned it again. I thought she might have memory issues because she had just told me a week earlier. A week later she mentioned a third time. I thought wow she really doesn't remember... Wait. I get it. Duh. I finally got the mega hint. She wanted me to do it too. Never thought I'd meet a girl that asked for anal.
2021-02-02 07:56:17,tifu,"Commenting on any woman's weight in either direction will never end well.  Just learn your lesson, and never go there again."
2021-02-02 07:56:17,tifu,Well if she’s gonna eat an entire person worth of cake
2021-02-02 07:56:14,tifu,"There’s a small chance your folks might have not known what it is.
Granted. I don’t know what yours looks like (Could have a giant cock image slapped to the side of it for all I know) but generally they’re usually just clear plastic tubes with a pump attached. Could easily be mistakes for medical equipment."
2021-02-02 07:55:53,tifu,Fanny. Grow up.
2021-02-02 07:55:42,tifu,They can control but if you're saying people are focused on appearance why even go there?
2021-02-02 07:55:29,tifu,Shit.  I saw a girl after she had gastric bypass and said the same thing (this was like 20 yrs ago).  I since realized - never ever comment on someone’s weight.
2021-02-02 07:55:25,tifu,"Dunno why it would be so hard for you to believe.  I’ve never peed in a pool, and it’s pretty disgusting that people do.  I can only hope I’m in the majority."
2021-02-02 07:55:23,tifu,"Get off your high horse. I loved getting comments when I lost a lot of weight through healthy eating and working out. It was a real self esteem boost, and I did it to try and be nicer to my knees and my back, that were killing me."
2021-02-02 07:55:17,tifu,"Oh god okay, I feel this one for you. Hopefully she just never mentions it.."

2021-02-02 07:55:08,tifu,"If logic was your strong suit you would probably recognize that some weight gain can also mean recovery from eating disorders, and therefore health."
2021-02-02 07:55:05,tifu,"Bro, what the fuck is wrong with you? Dont go blaming this on society as a scapegoat. Your fuck up is yours alone, you had already cheated on, then afterwards, had the audacity to continue talking to other women on tinder behind her back, you have issues and either need to seek help or look into poly relationships, assuming you can even respect another persons boundaries for the relationship"
2021-02-02 07:54:51,tifu,">Heeeere's your sign.

\- Bill Engvall"
2021-02-02 07:54:50,tifu,This this this! Losing that much weight that fast often indicates serious illness! Just don’t  make personal comments about people’s bodies.
2021-02-02 07:54:49,tifu,"You might be right, but you don't know who actually fits into that number so if it was me, I just wouldn't take the risk in case they actually can't help what weight they are.

It is about their appearance but like I said it is something they can control (I.e. they *chose* to dye their hair pink), but like I said there other ways of complimenting people that doesn't focus on appearance if you want to be extra safe (which isn't a bad thing)."
2021-02-02 07:54:43,tifu,"I knew someone who had that. His toenail just grew like that, and, well, with socks and shoes and maybe a little sweat, bacteria have a great time down there. Maybe a pedicurist has some advice. Those infections can really hurt."
2021-02-02 07:54:15,tifu,I got fatter just reading these messages
2021-02-02 07:54:09,tifu,Hopefully when the they get too light they'll notice the compliments stop. Or you can say something about it since it's easier to say someone's too skinny than too fat.
2021-02-02 07:54:00,tifu,It depends on the state. I'm from a state where everyone bags their own groceries. I moved to a state where the grocery store employees bag them all up for me. It was very off putting at first! I think it's to do with how the local unions and regulations were written differently from place to place.
2021-02-02 07:53:59,tifu,Yeah - I was just idly wondering in general terms whether embarrassment scales in proportion to the size of the sex toy :-D
2021-02-02 07:53:40,tifu,This is just one big OOF and I can't stop laughing
2021-02-02 07:53:26,tifu,"Happened to me too. I gained a lot of weight that time and we have a new hire employee who just signed her contract. During her interviews, she talked to the head of recruitment over the phone, who sent her regrets that she can’t be there for the contract signing as she is not feeling well (pregnant at the time). After the contract signing I went to the lobby to greet the new hire and she said “oh you came to work after all” i was confused so i asked her what she meant. She said “aren’t you the head of recruitment?” “Why would you think that?” “Cause you’re pregnant...” 

She still works with us and one of my closest friends but maaan i felt so bad for both of us."
2021-02-02 07:53:18,tifu,A guy did that to me lol but i guess it was my fault. I posted an old photo on instagram then he dm'ed me that i got so much thinner. The last time i saw him in person was around only a month before i posted it tho 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️
2021-02-02 07:52:53,tifu,"I would never recommend calling your doctor fat, especially not before a prostate exam"
2021-02-02 07:52:47,tifu,"There’s quite a bit of difference in saying “Oh, you’ve lost weight, you’re looking well” and “It’s like you shed an entire person’s worth of weight haha.” People who think they have the right to comment on people’s appearance/bodies are boring af."
2021-02-02 07:52:25,tifu,The End.
2021-02-02 07:52:04,tifu,fucking remove the slur from your post
2021-02-02 07:51:51,tifu,This could have been avoided by just not making comments about people's weight in the first place lmao
2021-02-02 07:51:04,tifu,"Thanks, friend! I was in a bad relationship and we were eating like shit: pizza all the time, so much beer, chain smoking. We were both so unhappy. So when he dumped me it was easy to change all of those habits pretty quickly. Stayed on friends couch for a bit —shes in the military and likes to work out and helped me get back into being active and eating right. Anyways it was a whole lifestyle transformation. That happened about 8 or so years ago at this point ... going through a similarly shitty breakup again rn fml"
2021-02-02 07:50:57,tifu,"It's probably a small number who actually can't. 

I mean even dying their hair pink is about their appearance. If that's the case we shouldn't compliment anything on appearance and compliment things such as actions only."
2021-02-02 07:50:53,tifu,this is why it’s better to just not comment on weight at all lol. even if they’re losing weight i think it’s not good to point it out as it’s not always for healthy reasons.
2021-02-02 07:50:49,tifu,I have no idea what kind of ego or entitlement you believe you have but you need to humble yourself and accept the fact that you fucked up by cheating to begin with. I’ve dated a narcissist like you before and they never ever will own up to their shit and always blame the other person. Get a fucking grip dude. I’m glad she was strong enough to leave your pathetic ass. And you expected her to just accept the fact you were unfaithful? Didnt on some other post you said she “gaslighted” you into believing you never did anything with her? No no I think you’re the one who’s gaslighting my guy. Having her “accept” the cheating is basically making her believe it was her fault somehow. That’s so fucked up and you don’t deserve her. Get some help cause you definitely need it my guy.
2021-02-02 07:50:46,tifu,You guys arent the only ones with sex toys. He probably chuckled to himself and then went about his business.

2021-02-02 07:50:18,tifu,"I too suffer from foot-in-mouth syndrome when trying to be funny. 
I had a coworker who was very pregnant a few years back. My cubicle faced the front of our entrance, which had about 5-6 steps down from the main entrance of the building and it had glass, etc.

I saw her coming down the stairs with heavily-pregnant-slowness, and I wanted to somehow make a joke about how she's obviously carrying a human being which makes things awkward and difficult.
But it came out as ""Looks like you've put on a little extra weight"" or something like that. 
Essentially I called her fat, while I was really just trying to convey that ""hey you've got a human inside of you!"" (She understood what I was going for I just worded it so poorly)
My other coworker tried to help me save it by saying ""In the form of another person!"" but.... 

Thankfully, the pregnant coworker is a very very nice person and she, at least did not act offended. 
And I no longer try to make jokes about how neat I find pregnancy."

2021-02-02 07:49:33,tifu,"Compared to his little five year old self it seemed pretty big, but no."
2021-02-02 07:49:02,tifu,"And in case this comment wasn’t enough to convince you that you can’t distinguish a pregnant woman from one who just has a larger than average belly for her body size:

Years ago, a family friend started gaining a lot of (what we thought was) belly fat. She was otherwise a very healthy weight and always had been, but she was in her teens at the time and everyone in our family and hers just seemed to assume that her body was changing and decided to put on a lot of weight all in one area. She *absolutely* looked pregnant though, and if I hadn’t heard it directly from her family that she wasn’t (and been around long enough to know that she’d been that way for a lot more than 9 months) I 100% would have assumed she was carrying a baby. She was still the same size she’d always been everywhere but her stomach.

After a couple of years, she was seeing a doctor about a different issue and they decided to do some scans of her stomach. Turns out she had a cyst the size of a soccer ball on one of her ovaries. They were able to remove it and now she’s back to her normal figure. But it pains me to think how many comments she must have gotten during that time about being pregnant and how much it probably sucked to keep having to tell people she wasn’t."
2021-02-02 07:48:53,tifu,Compared to you every person on earth is a relationship expert

2021-02-02 07:47:33,tifu,"Emotional cheating is still a form of cheating. 

Being more upfront about your desire to feel wanted will probably help. Take a self inventory and communicate better. Turning to cheating will erode trust every time."
2021-02-02 07:47:24,tifu,Quit nagging me.
2021-02-02 07:47:22,tifu,"It pretty much does. There is some variation, but not a whole lot. There are just varying degrees of unhealthiness. Someone a little over weight is a little unhealthy, but probably fine. A person seriously over weight probably has or will have health issues related to the extra weight."
2021-02-02 07:47:19,tifu,Well the baby is an entire person so technically she did gain the weight of a second person while pregnant.
