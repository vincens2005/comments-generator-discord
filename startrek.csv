2021-02-03 11:16:55,startrek,"Not sure why you're getting downvoted, this makes perfect sense. It didn't bother me that Starfleet *finally* has a fleet of battle-ready starships on call. Imagine how many times that would have been useful over the years, and in a Federation with hundreds of billions of people it shouldn't be difficult to keep them staffed. In fact, it seems ridiculous to assume that Starfleet Command would continue to have their scrapped-together fleets blown up with no thought as to fixing the problem.

My issue is that the fleets were so big that they were ridiculous. A secret cabal had a fleet larger than any Romulan fleet we have ever seen. Starfleet just happened to have their own massive fleet of roughly the same size, within an equal warp distance. Either Starfleet had the best intelligence available (and yet didn't realize that the flag officer in charge of security was a spy and the leader of the enemy force), or they just did it for the plot. And that just seems lazy."
2021-02-03 11:16:44,startrek,"Rick Bergman and Brannon Braga came very close to murdering the Star Trek franchise.

Berman ran off Terry Farrell due to incessant sexual harassment. He knew the phoney “Native American” cultural advisor from his PBS days and pushed for him to be on Voyager, which gave us Chakotay. If there hadn’t been all of"

2021-02-03 11:14:48,startrek,"They were not dead, though. And even if they were, we currently resuscitate people who are technically dead. Those lines move all the time with tech and it's one of my favorite recurring themes with Trek: Where do we draw the line when we have the ability to surpass natural limitations?

I wouldn't want to start handing out organs before death was a certainty. It's like opting in for experimental surgery instead of giving up."

2021-02-02 08:13:22,startrek,"I'm always happy to see more Star Trek, but I'm not a fan of the new Pike as a captain.  He's just way too casual with the crew, and I think he comes across as someone who is trying to be a ""cool boss""."

2021-02-02 08:13:07,startrek,My unpopular opinion is that I really like the Klingons and the new Klingon ship designs in Discovery especially the Klingon designs in season 1
2021-02-02 08:13:00,startrek,"It's not just that Star Trek is the ideal of humanity, to me, it's that Star Trek is actually kind of hopeful. Humanity **might** get better, there **might** be a future for the human race. Deep Space Nine was so good at examining how far Star Fleet and Sisko is willing to go to preserve that hope. Modern sci-fi just doesn't have any hope in it. It's too jaded and sad for me"
2021-02-02 08:12:58,startrek,"No. The OP states 'Is there **any** factual inacuracy in TNG. And the answer is, yes quite a lot i.e. mechanical modes of transport don't randomly give birth."

2021-02-02 08:11:49,startrek,I would have preferred if we got more closure on her character! She was a unique character and showed a more realistic approach to an Android. People would definitely bully an Android.

2021-02-02 08:10:18,startrek,"I thought season 3 was pretty good, but it rarely felt like a Star Trek show as much as The Expanse but not as good. Deep Space 9 was the only ‘classic’ Trek show that ever went to dark places tonally, and while it worked well for that show, I think it gave modern writers the wrong idea and caused them to create super gritty storylines without much room for the fun that defined much of TOS and TNG"
2021-02-02 08:09:47,startrek,There's one episode where Picard is trying his hand at proving Fermat's Last Theorem. This ended up being proven just a few years later (before TNG ended its run) and so the idea that it was still unproven in the 24th century is factually inaccurate.
2021-02-02 08:09:29,startrek,Season 3 of TNG by itself is better than all 3 seasons of DSC combined.
2021-02-02 08:09:20,startrek,"I'll have to review the episode. Really, though, why else would he have dormant arachnid genes? It's the only logical explanation."
2021-02-02 08:08:51,startrek,For some reason Insurrection struck me as one that would be a good episode rather than a movie.  But it was still pretty solid.
2021-02-02 08:08:46,startrek,Kes was a decent character who got fucked over by being solely identified as Neelix's girlfriend.

2021-02-02 08:08:25,startrek,"The problem is I think they wanted a McCoy-Spock type relationship between Pulaski and Data, but she just came off as unlikeable. 

Like that time she called Data ""Da-ta"" rather than ""Day-ta""."

2021-02-02 08:07:56,startrek,"Seven of nine was the worst thing that ever happened to Voyager..
 Turned a decent series into a boring never ending quest for lost humanity in a skintight bodysuit load of unwatchable rubbish.

.
Picard is an  outstanding series second only to ds9 imo


Simon Pegg is a great actor  in everything else he has done but the worst choice possible for Scotty... His appalling attempt at a Scottish   accent is laughable.. In fact he's the only one out the reboot films that I think is miscast."
2021-02-02 08:07:28,startrek,Picard is the best Star Trek content of any kind since DS9
2021-02-02 08:07:01,startrek,I've come around to this view quite recently myself
2021-02-02 08:06:51,startrek,"I don’t know if this is unpopular opinion, but it’s definitely a guilty pleasure...

My favorite moments from Trek tend to be cerebral or great character moments... but I freaking love the Beastie Boys scene from ST:Beyond.

“Is this classical music?”

lol it’s so dumb but it’s soooooo much fun to watch."
2021-02-02 08:06:48,startrek,I lost all respect for her character when she started banging that candle in space-scotland.
2021-02-02 08:06:15,startrek,"Star Trek was better after Gene Roddenberry died, and if he hadn't it wouldn't have gotten beyond TNG. 

Season 4 of Enterprise is possibly the best overall season of Trek. 

Picard had some really spectacular character moments. 

Seven of Nine was better in Picard, and her development was very believable. 

Couldn't care less about Icheb dying. 

Janeway was right to kill Tuvix. 

TNG has aged terribly."
2021-02-02 08:05:53,startrek,"As a Canadian,  I feel bad for him too. I hear it can sometimes get below 32F at night down there. Oh the humanity!"
2021-02-02 08:05:21,startrek,"No, I'm not. What is being confused is you are mixing up something **fictional** with something **nonfactual**. The OP is asking about ""factual inaccuracies"" but you are describing things that are fictional, not things are factually untrue.
Fictional != nonfactual. I cannot explain this point any clearer."
2021-02-02 08:05:04,startrek,"Star Trek IV is the most famous, non-Star Trek fan recognized Star Trek film of them all. As a lifelong fan, I love the 6 original movies (even TMP and Final Frontier)."
2021-02-02 08:04:59,startrek,"I believe the reason people hate Pulaski isn't that she's so crabby all the time. It's because she's an older lady with a perm. If she were a Bones-age guy or a younger woman, she would have never been replaced.  


(This is not necessarily to say I think sexism or ageism was at play here. I just think that her look is at odds with her personality, at least in the context of a sci-fi drama)"
2021-02-02 08:04:58,startrek,"I absolutely love ""Well, a double dumb ass on you!"". That movie is so quotable."

2021-02-02 08:03:17,startrek,"I think this about a lot of Old Trek today.

I remembered not liking Emissary (DS9 pilot), but when I watched it last night, it was excellent.

I think watching Picard and Disco is lowering my expectations so much that a lot of the old stuff is positively brilliant by comparison."
2021-02-02 08:03:04,startrek,i think Ezri would have been remembered more fondly had she been given another season.
2021-02-02 08:03:02,startrek,Especially the episode with the ghost. Solid gold
2021-02-02 08:02:41,startrek,I think Insurrection is probably my favorite unpopular Trek movie. TFF and Generations are really the only ones that I won't go out of my way to watch. I'll even admit that TFF had its moments but Generations should have been an epic movie and was just kind of contrived and boring.
2021-02-02 08:02:27,startrek,I can’t decide if I love or hate Uhura’s dirty dance.
2021-02-02 08:02:25,startrek,"1.  Far Beyond the Stars is a great episode of TV but a bad episode of Star Trek because it was shoehorned into the plot and made absolutely no sense as far as Siskos character went and what he had been through in his life.  It only made sense in Avery Brooks life but he only plays the character, he is not the character.

2.  When TNG was good it was very good but it was bad more often than good.

3.  Kelvin Trek > Original Trek"
2021-02-02 08:02:08,startrek,Wow. Man. I think you win haha!
2021-02-02 08:01:49,startrek,IIRC Phil has a 39% accuracy rating. You'd be better off just flipping a coin.

Except when it does.

2021-02-02 08:01:01,startrek,Didn't help that the Native American advisor they brought on for the show turned out to be a fraud.
2021-02-02 08:00:50,startrek,Is that last one unpopular?
2021-02-02 07:59:58,startrek,"Neelix was a great character. Ethan Phillips did an excellent job portraying a happy, optimistic dude plagued by deep sadness and trauma."

2021-02-02 07:59:39,startrek,"You're confusing soft sci fi with hard sci fi. ST isn't hard sci fi. And you can't factually prove a negative. You're argument could be used to state ""chocolate flavoured space dragons made of marshmallows are true because science hasn't proved they're not"". It's a total non sequitur."
2021-02-02 07:59:15,startrek,"It definitely had its moments and I think deep, deep, deep down there's an excellent movie buried somewhere in the mess. It also feels very much like an extension of TOS for me.

I also liked Nimbus III, the ""Planet of Galactic"" peace for what it was. I can definitely imagine diplomats coming up with this grand idea of a neutral planet symbolic of peace, prosperity, and cooperation but not investing anything in it and it just becoming a horrible dump because no sides are willing to allow other parties to back out."

You are so right about Enterprise, I put the best episodes of seasons 3/4 right up there among some of the best Trek."
2021-02-02 07:57:10,startrek,"I love The Final Frontier. 
I sometimes wish they developed the show out of the original pilot episode.
I can't get enough of Star Trek Timelines, the mobile game."

2021-02-02 07:54:25,startrek,My thoughts also. Discovery is so terrible it makes me appreciate everything that came before and even some non-trek sci-fi that I haven't seen in a while.
2021-02-02 07:54:12,startrek,"3 is fine, it’s the best of the odds. It’s also important to the overall arc.

I tell people to watch 2, 3, 4, 6. 6 is sort of standalone, but it’s so good."

2021-02-02 07:52:48,startrek,"No. It isn't factually **untrue** unless science has disproven it, that's the point. We know the limits of the speed of light, so an allowance has to be made for why this scientific law can be broken.

In general he attributed a fair bit of other people's work to himself either through ommission or distorting things to make him seem the better person.

He is also one the few people who was in a position to rape and then fire Grace Lee Whitney back on S1 of TOS."

Having episodes set *entirely* in the Mirror Universe killed it for me - kind of groundbreaking actually.  Seems like Disco thought the same thing and tried that this past season (even if we can argue it was an alternate timeline in the alternate universe caused by an alternate being with alternative powers)."
2021-02-02 07:49:41,startrek,"Lol, I loved how, during the credits for ""What We Left Behind"", they made a big deal about how they needed to run the ""greatest clip in Star Trek history"" or however they put it.

And it really is a good episode. It really shows Quark and Odo in good form (and Shimerman *kills it* when he begs them not to make him choose who dies). I really enjoyed the variety of responses to the odd situation the other four had. And to be frank, I loved the aliens. I'm a bit of a gamer, myself. I'd be as excited by them as Sisko would have been if someone came through the wormhole wanting to play a game that involved hitting a ball with a stick."
