2020-12-04 18:22:19,ketchup,The best kind.
2020-12-04 17:40:08,ketchup,Agreed. But try the chipotle version. Itâ€™s takes it to a whole new level.
2020-12-04 17:14:11,ketchup,It's tasty.  Possibly with some tabaso as well.

2020-11-25 02:31:13,ketchup,You're welcome I didn't even have to leave my desk lol.
2020-11-24 22:29:36,ketchup,"And let me be honest if it's shipped to Syria if possible  it would be very expensive that I can't afford it tho , thanks for the suggestion"
2020-11-24 21:59:11,ketchup,"I don't think you can , cause I live in Syria tho 

Thanks 

Edit: typo"
2020-11-24 21:54:20,ketchup,DM me your contact info and I will ship you some a bottle or two

2020-10-25 07:04:45,ketchup,Iâ€™d be interested in just getting a sticker of the label and slap that on my old existing bottle in the fridge
2020-10-25 05:11:27,ketchup,What a lame Halloween celebration Heinz. You ship more bottles than that to a corner store and like you just put the word blood on the label? that's it? It just seems so half assed and lazy. I guess it's better than giving away 57 bottles...
2020-10-25 03:57:48,ketchup,Ketchup themed superhero that conducts electricity and does magneto things with ketchup? Interesting.....
2020-10-19 05:04:35,ketchup,yeah it's good and better for you without sugar
2020-09-13 11:53:36,ketchup,Didn't your parents tell you not to play with your food? ðŸ˜€
2020-09-09 14:00:01,ketchup,So this is how the next global health catastrophe starts huh? (/s)
2020-09-09 05:00:32,ketchup,You might need to add some magnetic metal to it. Get some iron dust in there.
2020-09-08 15:15:58,ketchup,Try it
2020-09-04 12:25:47,ketchup,You know he is going to never eat it now so if he doesnt have it it will hopefully last longer. Which will translate into him never having a taste for it. You just changed his palate for ketchup for the whole rest of his life from this incident. You should feel sad about that. Studies show kids who dont like ketchup are more likely to get less nutrients and possibly slowly starve from the inside out on a cellular level due to lack of oxygenation to your chromosome mitochondria. Something to consider when your kid chooses to use honey mustard instead if ketchup. They might asphyxiate from the collarbone up.
2020-09-04 12:19:56,ketchup,That's so fuckin cool bro seriously I'm fuckin impressed and shit bro
2020-08-31 19:42:26,ketchup,"2 (6oz) cans tomato paste (approx. 1 1/3 cups)

2/3 cup to 1 cup of water

1/3 cup apple cider vinegar

1/4 cup pitted dates or date paste

2 teaspoons sea salt

 

If using date paste, you can place all the ingredients in a medium bowl and stir until completely mixed.  Instead of going through the step of making date paste first, I put all the ingredients in a food processor, use the higher amount of water and mix until completely smooth."
2020-08-31 19:29:16,ketchup,Can you share your recipe please?!
2020-08-17 18:07:56,ketchup,The secrets for which you seek lie deep beyond the archives of the Heinz headquarters

2020-07-23 10:11:54,ketchup,No I agree with but your trash Heinz is and always will be superb
2020-07-23 10:11:05,ketchup,If Iâ€™m right in believing that the queen is on the left and the squirt bottle is on the right then your dead wrong because the squirt bottle is most definitely superior

2020-05-22 11:23:52,ketchup,"Some are sensitive to sweetness and/or sourness more than others. For some, the sugar and vinegar in ketchup can be too much. Their loss."
2020-05-22 10:34:44,ketchup,My mom's bff uses mayo
2020-05-22 10:07:55,ketchup,"Mayo and gravy are very good, I can appreciate that"

2020-05-17 01:02:30,ketchup,An excellent choice my friend. You shall now be injected with a lethal dose of Heinz Ketchup. May Lord Kimheinzanny have mercy on your soul.
2020-05-16 17:25:44,ketchup,Annie's is really good!
2020-05-16 09:25:04,ketchup,Heinz because I grew up with it!
2020-05-16 04:24:22,ketchup,"I've actually never heard of this one. But anyways, would you prefer being injected with Annie's ketchup or Heinz ketchup? (You're gonna die either way, but I'd like it if you chose Heinz, as your last act of redemption)"
