Are your 𝗴𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀 doing the 𝗿𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 during the pandemic?

The COVID-19 crisis justified governments to exert 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗰𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗽𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿 through law and enforcement to curb the public health crisis. COVID-19 also creates favourable condition for governments to reinforce existing 𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗴𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗼𝘁𝘆𝗽𝗲𝘀 on **race, gender and marginalised communities**.

During the pandemic, issues like the **hardening of state regulatory power** with the declaration of emergency, the lockdown causing the rise of **domestic violence**, **policing of the homeless and migrants** perpetuating blames and stigmatization towards these already vulnerable groups have become invisible - the new normal.

The 𝗗𝗲𝗺𝗼𝗰𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘆 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝗲𝘅 statistics from 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗼𝗺𝗶𝘀𝘁 Intelligence Unit also showed that the global score of democracy is the lowest recorded since 2006. This indicates that the global pandemic has eroded democracy from aspects of civil liberties, political participation, electoral process and pluralism, the functioning of government to democratic political culture.

The bigger question is - Are we even aware of these issues that go on during the pandemic anymore? These issues concern not just a part of the population, but the voice of the nation as whole, during and post the pandemic.

Join us as we walk you through:

* Foucault’s Biopolitics and it’s relation to state regulatory powers hardened during the pandemic.
* The stigmatization, oppression and inequalities based on gender, sexuality and race in society during this pandemic
* How COVID-19 creates favorable conditions for state disciplinary power to reinforce stigmatization, traditional gender roles, sexual dimorphism and sexual diversity.

Most importantly, you would walk away as a more informed citizen, with a stronger asset to evaluate 𝗴𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀, and 𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗽𝘀 you can take to make a difference in the community post the pandemic.

The ***guest speaker*** for this event is [*𝗗𝗿. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗼𝗻 𝗔. 𝗕𝗼𝗻𝗴*](https://www.monash.edu.my/sass/about/staff/academic/associate-professor-sharon-a-bong), Associate Professor and Major Coordinator of Gender Studies at Monash University, who is also a strong advocate for social justice and inclusivity, particularly gender justice at international, regional and national levels.

The event will take place on January 30, 2021 8-9.30PM GMT+8 (MYT). The event is free of charge, but registration is required to attend.

Methods and Operations - Classic Idiotic Privacy Invasion, With Claim of Secrecy and Unrecusability: Textbook Criminality

All attempts at compensation for technical legalistic inability to do anything in a given situation; mindless muck attempting to enable itself through sheer claim of prerogative and phenomenal disconnectedness. Their total irresponsibility, pure brainless idiocy - and the stubborn false charge. Their attempt to get even with the law, and extend abuse to all possible cases, and not dissociate from it. Vigilantism, in other words.

Their forms of compensation are fourfold:

Explicit Understatement
Implied Overtone
Psychological Preemption
Physical Shock
Manifested confusion, falsehood, inanity, non-threat, and categorically mistaken attempted alienation. The mistaken premise, in other words.

Their absence of mind seems to know no bounds, nor does their chagrined criminality.

Their method of operation - pinning their criminality on others (specifically with regard to trying to take advantage):

Unilateral Accusation of Criminality
Attempted PR-Diversion
Trying to Get Away With It
Categorically Oversimplified False Construance
Attempted Snideness
Pure retards, in other words; who will die out, even if I have to kill them. Injustice itself, so corrupt it can never gain a footing.

An indication of primordial lawlessness and unscrupulousness which needs to be corrected. The Achilles' Heel, and biggest problem, of modern civilization.

In summation, greater judicial transparency and warrant requisites need to be enacted as a part of social reform, and the curbing of unannounced and potentially classified covert stealth technologies needs to be limited stringently against the American public, in protection of the falsely accused - a reaffirmation of the Constitution.

They represent an effort to forego a hearsay charge and claim a ""who says"" - all an extension of property arbitration, aloof to the citizen and the individual, perpetually missing the point with their indefensible circular - and hollow - nonsensical banter. Pure thieves. Circumstantial know-nothings attempting to make a bad situation worse. They are the impertinently retarded.

Their 7 Persistent Characteristics:

Speech Impediment, Not Free Speech Impediment
Backwards, Not Progressive
Misjudging Character, Not Character Judge
Unfathomably Stupid, Not Covertly Incalculable
Artificially Sabotaging, Not Legitimately Challenging
Pseudo-Victimizing, Not Actual Victimizing
Shallow and Unaccountable, Not Privileged or Discerning
Everything they do in such non-overseen position is self-contradictory and inconsistent. They are a classic imbecile; common confusion falsely maintaining its status quo. They are doomed, unconstitutional attempted torturers and rapists, not a precedent.

Please make a story out of this.

INSIPID MODERN EVIL (POLICE UNACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRUPTION) (self.government)

submitted 1 month ago * by Decoder_1

PUBLIC CORRUPTION -

Attempted Modern Fascism

[""GPS"" Abuse]

A Volatile Situation Concerning the Abuse of Police Privileges, Attempting to Evade Penalization, and Enforce Humdrum Corruption As Routine - the Sum Extent of Police Misconduct and Wrongful Accusation

General indecency and no due process . . . the extent of their logical fallacies (""might vs. right""):

I. PREMISES - Misconstruance

I have reason to believe I am being wrongfully pursued maliciously by the local police, stemming from a slanderous report by my mother in Omaha, and fueled by subsequent misreporting of a psychiatric nature. Leading to a situation of primitive profiling - and harassment and stalking from the local community. I am under constant stress and torment and I can't function, and face constant negative reinforcement from the locals, to the point at which I can't manage daily affairs. It is a situation in which I am repeatedly assumed to be indefensible, and I can never voice justification for my side of things - the opposite of free and democratic processes, and the course of citizens' liberties; a perverse distortion and abuse of undercover privilege, and a precise attempt to stifle any opposition. They seem to be comprised of lowest common denominator rabble, with absolutely no sense of propriety or even irony in their exact criminality - attested to by a sheer statistically anomalous observable snide chagrin of reinforced privacy invasion. I am functionally rendered a ""false positive"" in every way. They seem to be trying to justify injustice with more injustice in a vicious cycle - which needs to be ended. They are clearly consumed with a God complex, and an obsession with plausible deniability in defense of the criminally unjustifiable, invoking circumstantial immunity to the point of abusing the system and claiming blamelessness in place of actual irresponsibility. They are a scourge which represents what should be eliminated - and not suffered under attribution to simply mundane misfortune, and random chance. Their audacity and assumed impertinence seems to know no bounds - but they are crossing a line with purported injuriousness. One from which there can be no resurrection. Their operation seems to be as brainless as it is overwhelmingly evident - and cannot be allowed to set a precedent.

Please research, intervene, and cease their absolutely unbridled misconduct.

For the sake of all that is good.

II. IMPLICATIONS - Category Mistake

I am witnessing observable residuals of apparent misreporting of events, unbeknownst to me - in which I am undoubtedly being misconstrued as an unstable problem, however the direct technical intervention of the work of the statistically traceable, inferable, and presumptuous authorities in the matter have only served to undermine and aggravate an imposed quagmire, analogous to a corrupt legalistic catch-22; an attempted loophole in democracy analogous to an innocent person being found guilty. Only here it is entirely extrajudicial, and seems to be a classic sheriff judge, jury, and executioner, enabled by remote technology and wireless surveillance techniques - here, primarily, towards the end of doctoring and fabricating an attempted easily-managed pigeonholing. All in stark contradiction to inalienable rights such as free speech and privacy, not to mention the standard of evidence, objective fact, due process, the judicial system, and innocent until proven guilty - all attempting vindication through laissez-faire secrecy. Please advocate on my behalf in principle alone, as this ostensible failing of early-stage modern technology, and accompanying police tactics, is Un-American and should be addressed and resolved as such. This must not continue in America; it is the very definition of injustice.

III. DRAWN CONCLUSIONS - Strawman Argument

I believe I am currently on a citizens' patrol watchlist and am being subject to deleterious auxiliary law enforcement accoutrements, the likes of which include traditional civilian and undercover police tactical stakeout methods and technical faculties . . . all only peripherally inferable by me and without adequate representation or explanation. I believe I am being attacked and compromised on suspicion alone and the surprise offensive element needs to cease, in preservation of civility and society. Observable indications have reached an unacceptable critical point, and I am forced to be harmfully over-wary, to the point of physical health detriment. The covert elements can only be malicious, and represent a derangement of all possible sense and order. They are increasingly pernicious and reckless and represent a general stupidity which is trying to falsely demonize me, and I am forced to be subject to their statistically undeniable and increasingly noticeable hearsay. They represent a purely brainless stupidity which operates on such a level, and need to be eliminated. They are a negative precedent for due process and law and order. Halt their out-of-place and misinformed harassment to society.

IV. CASE CLOSED - Ad Hominem

I am a victim of domestic abuse from relatives growing up, incidents which range from extreme neglect, to beatings with belt and other blunt objects, to strangulation, to malnourishment - with several other things ranging from constant threat, to dragging, to forcible removing from safe environments, to misreporting and lying, to distorting the truth, to vindictive betrayal, to anything anyone could imagine, on a daily basis. I believe I am currently being incidentally manhandled by the law as an extension of this, in traceless subterfuge, manifesting itself as visible taunting, harassment, imbecility, perversion, double standards, would-be discrimination, and overall a revelation of absolute mental retardation on the part of the perpetrators; with repeated insinuations of hopelessness, helplessness, and relentlessness, furthering the abuse into quagmires of attempting to inculpate effects or signs of the abuse. I believe it is being carried out by any and all measures - including privileged technical methods involving LASER radar and tear gas analogues, to notable community stalking as an extension of the citizens' patrol, and neighborhood watch - and it is a constant, the ostensible goal of which is to induce impoverishment and homelessness to the point at which death occurs by either strain and desolation or misguided, uninformed confrontation - as has been the trend. I have been forced to circumstantially take extreme measures to defend myself and propriety, which seem to be recused faultily, ipso facto. The perpetrators need to be brought to justice, as this constitutes a basic violation of law. The worst part of all is their claim of blamelessness; it is nothing short of charading criminality - sheer false accusation.

I am witnessing evidence of regimented police persecution in all manner of types that can be taken, undoubtedly stemming from unsupported accusations from relatives, taking the form of an untenable, presumptuous loophole in due process, and an effort to exact extrajudicial punishment as an overstepping of traditional surveillance methods - all citing clandestine privilege, and no representation in the law. It takes the visible form of community stalking, and indications of ostensible surveillance.

V. CASE IN POINT - Non-Impartiality

This is all like an Orwellian ""1984"" situation, and I am a functioning Constitutional protagonist of free speech. The definition of a Salem witch hunt - and attempted subterfuge totalitarian force. The corrupt anti-object of the moral of every story - the ultimate failings of society and civilization. This is clearly like ""The Crucible"", ""The Scarlet Letter"", and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" - in other words, earliest American civilization; the more things change, the more they stay the same. It's as if everyone has learned nothing.

Sheer mindless rabble persecution.

Please alert the public as to their deviance."

Workers Vanguard No. 1136 29 June 2018

Internet Censorship Law Endangers Sex Workers

Carrying signs reading ""Sex Work ≠ Trafficking"" and ""Stigma Kills,"" large crowds of sex workers and their supporters gathered in New York, Oakland, Chicago and other cities across the country on June 2, dubbed ""International Whores' Day."" They were protesting a set of anti-sex bills that Donald Trump signed into law on April 11. The House version, ""Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act"" (FOSTA), and its Senate equivalent, SESTA, flew through Congress on bipartisan wings. Supporters of the law cynically claim the bill supports women's rights. In reality, the law further criminalizes consensual sexual activity and imposes government censorship of the internet by making internet service providers, social media and dating websites responsible for user-generated content (e.g., ads by escorts and massage parlors).

Once again, right-wing outfits--such as Expose Sex Ed Now, which is devoted to opposing sex education for minors, and the virulently anti-gay and anti-communist Institute on Religion and Democracy--and prominent liberal Democrats and anti-Trump ""resisters"" have joined hands in an unholy alliance to enhance the repressive machinery of the capitalist state. The bill was supported by ""progressives"" like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, feminist groups like the National Organization for Women, as well as pro-Democratic celebrities like Seth Meyers and Amy Schumer.

Nina Hartley, the porn star, sex educator and fighter for sexual freedom, got it exactly right when she told Workers Vanguard:

""SESTA-FOSTA are both anti-labor as well as anti-woman. Again, under the guise of 'helping victims of sex trafficking' women's choices regarding their bodily autonomy are under attack. Workers who had moved from the streets to indoors, who used the internet to screen clients, have been pushed back onto the streets, where pimps are again gaining the upper hand over workers.""

Social scientists at Baylor and West Virginia universities published a 2017 study documenting that screening clients through Craigslist's erotic services reduced the risk of rape to female prostitutes, with the homicide rate dropping 17.4 percent. Now, the very basic safety precaution of screening clients has been taken away, forcing many back onto the streets to face homelessness, arrest, harassment, beatings or worse. One sex worker told WV that as soon as FOSTA-SESTA passed, the number of calls she received from pimps on her work phone dramatically increased. Under FOSTA-SESTA, immigrant sex workers, always under threat of deportation, are especially vulnerable. Many had used sites like Craigslist to advertise their services, either as individuals or through massage parlors, which allowed them a modicum of safety. Meanwhile, gay and trans prostitutes, who already risk lethal violence in this deeply bigoted country, will be further endangered.

People will die as a result of this law. A protester at the June 2 demonstration in Oakland noted, ""My personal experience before I used the internet as a platform for sex work was getting assaulted constantly, getting kidnapped, getting raped, getting drugged."" The protester's sign aptly read, ""FOSTA SESTA Has a Body Count.""

FOSTA-SESTA essentially nullifies Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That section, which is referred to as the ""safe harbor"" clause, ensured that, like a library, social media platforms, websites and internet service providers could publish or host material without being liable for its content. Most websites simply do not have the resources to handle potential lawsuits over any and every online posting, meaning that many platforms will likely heavily censor users or shut down entirely.

The repercussions of FOSTA-SESTA were felt before the ink on the new legislation was dry. In the lead-up to the legislation, the FBI seized B ack p age do t com, a site commonly used by sex workers to post ads and safely meet clients. The home of its cofounder Michael Lacey was raided, and he is now facing federal charges. Immediately after the bills were passed, Craigslist removed its entire personals section (including Missed Connections), and sites used by sex workers to post ads, like Night Shift and City vibe, shut down entirely. According to En gadget com, sites that facilitated safety in sex work have shut down their discussion boards, advertising boards and community forums. Microsoft, which owns Skype and Messenger, changed its policies to target ""inappropriate"" and ""offensive"" behavior.

The new law is part of a broader escalation of online censorship, often carried out under the guise of combating ""fake news""--i.e., allowing the public to see only what the rulers and their media deem appropriate. Even before FOSTA-SESTA was signed into law, Facebook shut down about 500 accounts of Palestinian journalists and publications, including the Safa Palestinian Press Agency, a major news outlet. The capitalist rulers will seek to use their augmented repressive powers over the internet to silence leftists, anti-racist activists, labor organizers and anyone else the U.S. government deems a threat.

FOSTA-SESTA equates the fundamentally consensual act between a prostitute and a client to exchange money for sex with the horrific crime of forced sex trafficking. Proponents of the law pushed it by feeding hysteria over a supposed epidemic of young teens forced into the sex trade. Such lies are an old and tired trick used by the capitalist rulers to further expand their repressive powers. As we explained in ""U.S./UN Crusade Against 'Sex Trafficking'"" (Spartacist [English-language edition] No. 58, Spring 2004):

""The atrocities that are still thriving worldwide in this reactionary social and economic climate include forced marriages, the buying and selling of children, forced segregation under the head-to-toe veil, female genital mutilation and 'honor killings.' Coerced prostitution, which has existed for thousands of years, is likely increasing. But the repressive measures adopted by capitalist states in the name of 'human rights' and 'protecting women' will only intensify these miseries through state persecution.""

In many ways, sex workers are the canaries in the coal mine for online censorship. The capitalist state is targeting sex workers for the same reason serial killers often do--they think they can get away with it because society deems them expendable. It is in the interest of the working class to fight against censorship and to defend the most vulnerable and oppressed sectors of the population. Sex workers face discrimination in all aspects of life. Renting an apartment is extremely difficult without official pay stubs; health care is beyond reach; and sex work isn't exactly something one can put on a résumé. Sex work should be legalized, and its workers organized into unions!

As in all areas of life under capitalism, a class divide exists in the sex industry. Stormy Daniels, a sex worker who is being hypocritically championed by anti-Trump Democrats, is unlikely to have trouble finding work or paying her bills as a result of the law. Nor will the Washington madams frequented by lawmakers on Capitol Hill have to close up shop. The law is intended to punish the most vulnerable sex workers, and in racist America a disproportionate number of impoverished sex workers are black. The FBI reports that young black people make up 55 percent of prostitution arrests of minors. The idea that the capitalist state, whose cops gun down blacks and minorities with impunity, is concerned about the welfare of women is obscene. Sex workers routinely do not report acts of violence against them because of the harassment and brutality, including rape, they often face at the hands of the police.

We are opposed to the criminalization of prostitution, and we oppose all laws against ""crimes without victims."" The government should not have the right to interfere in people's private, sexual lives. We are against any categorical criminalization of a sex act, including through reactionary ""age of consent"" laws, which dictate a sexless existence to teenagers. We advocate nothing more and nothing other than effective consent between individuals in whatever form of sex they choose.

As Marxists, we understand that it is the institution of the family that brings money into sexual relations. It is private property that requires monogamy from women, forcing them into the home to have babies, cook, clean and screw on command. Capitalist law, the social opprobrium against ""sin"" as defined by organized religion, and a pile of laundry are all that distinguish the wife from the prostitute in this fundamental sense. The working-class family is taught that the mother must be a slave to her children and household, and the father must work to provide for his family or he is not a man. This is the ideology the ruling class peddles so that each family accepts the burden of raising the next generation of wage slaves.

As revolutionary socialists, we fight for a future society in which women will have genuine social and political equality. This requires replacing the family and its private enslavement of women. Following a socialist revolution, the working class in power would collectivize childcare, laundry, cooking, cleaning and education. Once these tasks are removed from the shoulders of wives and mothers, women can stand fully equal to men as productive members of

society. Only then will prostitution--and its twin institution, the family--be relegated to the dustbin of history.
