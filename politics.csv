2021-02-03 11:17:27,politics,">And even they would get to experience a society that was more functional, cleaner, and healthy.

I agree with your entire post but this wouldn't interest them. 

Have you ever met someone worth hundreds of millions or really ""old"" money? They aren't ALL the same but there are some recurring themes amongst them. 

They are so disconnected from society that even their social cues are different. All the super rich keep one another's company in a giant circle jerk, reinforcing negative traits of wealth. 

Servant not good enough? Buy a new one. You can pay whatever per year and get anyone willing.

Landscape guy no good? Buy his company and change how they do business. 

Bank giving your buddy a hard time about a loan? Buy the bank. 

You can do and say anything you want because there are no repurcussions. Your servants aren't going to respond to abuse, they take it with their check. People selling them shit aren't going to treat them badly. No matter how much they misbehave, there really are no real world consequences for it. 

Add that through a few generations of old money and you've got a narcissistic megalomaniac who has no empathy or understanding of what it means to be part of a society outside their circle. 

They don't give a fuck about the wellbeing of the public because what the public have is good enough in the eyesnif the rich (millionaires still millionairing).

I wish they cared. I wish philanthropy from the rich was actually about giving a shit about people. But it's more often than not about a tax break or petty competitions to see whose college daughter can raise more money so girls in Africa can have Prada bags at cost. Giving to the arts is seen as ""sophisticated"" and ""proof that our society is great"" and not about the more important human aspects of the importance of art in all forms and it's immense impact. God forbid they see the beauty in it.

Anyway, that's my stoned rant for the day."

2021-02-03 11:17:19,politics,"Requiring funding of retirement benefits as they accrue is sensible, it prevents the accumulation of an enormous unfunded liability.  It ensures that costs are paid when they're incurred rather than kicking the can down the road and passing costs on to future generations.

That requirement is not the problem, the problem is the aggressive timeline to transition from funding benefits as they're disbursed to funding them as they're accrued, and at the same time not being able to improve profitability by controlling prices.

> “Under the Presidential Records Act, all Trump White House visitor logs are under the control and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration, and cannot be unilaterally released by the Biden White House,” a White House spokesperson said on Wednesday, following inquiries from reporters during a press briefing the day before...

> One lawyer told POLITICO late last year that the Biden administration would not have “carte blanche” access to Trump administration records and would be required to make a request to NARA to locate a particular record.


> “NARA would then need to consult with a representative of the relevant former president before providing it to the current White House,” the lawyer said. “But that is rare, and is usually done only when there is some novel issue that presents itself and the current administration is curious about how its predecessor handled it.”"

Yes people have more money to spend, yes people will earn a living wage, to only those who can produce such labor. But at the end of the day the people who are going to be negatively impacted by such policies, are the ones whom which the policy was made to protect. It makes goods and services more expensive, and if I can't get a job because no one wants to pay $15/hr for $10/hr of work I can produce, I can't afford anything.
