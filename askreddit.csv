2021-02-03 11:17:48,AskReddit,"I've been mates with these crows for like 3 years now and all they have gifted me was a single mussel off the beach lmao.  Yeah i would suggest peanuts in shell (because crows love to crack them open) and fresh water, but if you have squirrels you might be outta luck. It would be cool if they accepted you into their gang.. I introduced myself to the crows with a fish head with eyes still intact 

Ravens are amazing, I was sad I havent been able to visit london because of corona, the ravens there always sonic attack us with their weird little screams and I love it. Theres also parakeets, Egyptian geese, ducks etc I love it. 

I'm also proud to say I have fed every type of corvid in the uk 😭"

2021-02-03 11:17:44,AskReddit,"I mean twins aren't super rare. 1% to 2% in the US. But most of those would be fraternal twins, who wouldn't really get much of any sort of advantage. Identical twins are more rare, and even then they probably aren't really going to ""get away"" with anything, as much as they'd like to."
2021-02-03 11:17:44,AskReddit,"I would like to thank OP for putting this out there - my husband and I have been following the comments and watched some FANTASTIC movies in January!

Inception, Shutter Island, The Prestige, Interstellar, The Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind...

So to wrap it up, here are my three!  Salem's Lot / Bridesmaids / The Prestige (or Sixth Sense...you can't unsee that ending.  I still remember the face tingling, jaw dropping feeling of seeing it the first time)"

2021-02-03 11:17:43,AskReddit,"It's terribly difficult. Mostly because it's an isolated language, so people have few references to make to their own mother tongues.

It does have tenses (and a few 'unique' ones too, like regrettable tense), but it doesn't have plural nouns, for example. Loads of odd characteristics. Wrapping your head around the spoken language is very possible, but writing it is different beast entirely.

If you do plan on living there for a while I definitely recommend learning at least a little bit though!"

2021-02-03 11:17:42,AskReddit,"I used to like one of the  **fraternal twins** and one is a guy and the other is a girl. So this was back in year 5 when i invited them to my b-day party, i spoke to this girl a lot and then she told me she has a special gift for me and yeah i was all excited turns out it was a letter (BOTH THEIR NAMES ON THE LETTER &amp; A GIFT VOUCHER). Its been over 8 years and one day i stumbled across the letter and was laughing at it and cherishing the moments i had."
2021-02-03 11:17:42,AskReddit,My cousins are identical twins and only one of them passed their drivers license in the beginning. So they just shared the drivers license. It was only until the other twin got a ticket for speeding that he decided they stop sharing a license.

2021-02-03 11:17:38,AskReddit,"I've been told at my current employer that even if people lie in their resume about a qualification (as long as it's not safety related or legally required for the role you do), then there can legally be few repurcussions if you pass your probation period.

So for example if you never finished your IT degree but are working in IT successfully, even if you're found out they can't fire you (although they can make your life miserable)"

2021-02-03 11:17:33,AskReddit,I learnt this when my towels started getting moldy from washing! Apparently using the recommended amount of detergent leads to residue on fabric which can get moldy with time. I halved the amount of detergent and the laundry is clean and smells nice. Adding vinegar during washing also helped.
2021-02-03 11:17:33,AskReddit,Probably one time when I made a drawing I really liked on the front of my sketchbook. It was actually quite nice and made a good sketchbook cover. Then I went to my (at the time) girlfriend's house and her little sister drew it a new face with some permanent markers that also ruined the pic under it.

2021-02-03 11:17:30,AskReddit,"The ""O"" is only broken by the ""I"" for controls where a switch is a power *toggle*.  For controls where a button is always the ""on"" button, it will be labelled with the ""I"" only, and if a button is a power ""off"" button, it will be labelled with the ""O"" only.   (You might not see this on discrete buttons very often, but when you have a rocker switch controlling the power, one side of the switch will be ""O"", and the other will be ""I"".)"

2021-02-03 11:17:21,AskReddit,"They may not rust, but aluminum does corrode especially when exposed to salt air/water. Aircraft aluminum is 7075 iirc which I'm sure would be anodized to protect it from the elements but if the plane crashed, or even was stressed in the landing, or landed on water, or sank to the bottom was and assailed by saltwater and sand over decades, it would almost certainly corrode. Any pits created in the aluminum would cause fatigue cracks, starting a cycle of the aluminum wasting away. 7075 isn't weldable so all those rivets holding the body together have thru holes that likely had stress cracks upon any impact, etc etc.

So yeah, while Aluminum doesn't rust it does corrode significantly, ask anyone who bought a cheaply anodized aluminum umbrella or any product and lives near a beach."

2021-02-03 11:17:18,AskReddit,"It looks like the Washignton Post updated their database. There's only 11 shootings now. 

* Ya one killing was by a black cop and another was form an asian cop. So, hardly the result of ""white supremacy.""
* One was shot by a female cop after he refused to listen to stop approaching her.
* Two others were the result of the victim continuing to accelerate his vehicle when told to halt.
* One was a crazy guy running around the neighborhood naked.  
* I think the worst one is from Officer DeCruz how says he accidentally discharged his gun after attempting an arrest after the victim was speeding.

So ya, in 90% of these cases, I would have shot the guy too.

But that's the problem. Everybody is going to see things from their own perspective. For the liberals, it just doesn't matter. ANY black person shot by police is wrong for ANY reason whatsoever.

But anyway, here's the short list:

1. Christopher Whitfield - Shot by a black police officer (Deputy Glenn Sims Sr.) after a suspected robbery and struggle.

2. Jimmy Atchison - wanted for allegedly stealing a cell phone at gunpoint. He was shot by Asian officer Sung Kim who thought he was holding a weapon when the arrest was attempted.

3. Melvin Watkins - shot when he tried to run down a deputy with his car.

4. Channara ""Philly"" Pheap - Shot when choking Knoxville Police Department Officer Dylan Williams

5. Ryan Twyman - shot when officers attempted to perform an arrest and Twyman continued to accelerate his vehicle. Video available.

6. Isaiah Lewis - His girlfriend called 911 because Lewis was ""flipping out"" and running around the neighborhood naked. Police tazed Lewis but later shot him when the tazer failed to subdue him.

7. Marcus McVae - drug dealer and well known San Angelo was shot after fighting a cop who was attempting to arrest him.

8. Marzues Scott - attacked a store employee in Blytheville and later shot by a female officer after he refused to stop approaching her. Body cam video available.

9. Kevin Mason - Officers were called to the scene following a domestic dispute in which Mason told 911 ""You need to tell these police to get the (expletive) away from my door. If they don't, I'm gonna come out there and blast their (expletive) and kill every last one of them."" An officer opened fire after Mason aggressively approached the police and refused to follow commands to stop.

10. Michael Dean - sped away from officers who attempted to pull him over for speeding. When he did finally stop, police approached the vehicle with guns drawn. Officer DeCruz told investigators he fired the gun on accident when reaching for Dean's car keys.

11. Josef Richardson - shot during the serving of a warrant. Disputed"
