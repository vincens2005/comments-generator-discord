Also Emmett is hilarious"
2021-02-02 08:07:00,twilight,These are hilarious
2021-02-02 07:47:08,twilight,Fucking nailed it. Spot on.
2021-02-02 07:34:13,twilight,My sides are in orbit!
2021-02-02 07:15:47,twilight,Love this. Most iconic scenes in my opinion.
2021-02-02 07:03:55,twilight,I love how Edwards face just matches his statement XD
2021-02-02 06:53:12,twilight,Jasper and Emmett is spot on
2021-02-02 06:49:32,twilight,Lmao at the dig at bella. Shouldn't carlisle and esme be switched?
2021-02-02 06:37:54,twilight,😂😂
2021-02-02 06:21:27,twilight,LMAO Jacob’s has me dead 💀💀😂 you’ve got me spiting out my coffee this morning OP
2021-02-02 06:17:03,twilight,Carlisle's sent me
2021-02-02 06:10:00,twilight,Mind readers are people too. Justice for our mind readers 🥺
2021-02-02 05:00:12,twilight,"For real, look at that volume!!"
2021-02-02 04:34:52,twilight,We need a stop motion movie with this!😱😭
2021-02-02 03:59:15,twilight,theyre on youtube
2021-02-02 01:49:04,twilight,"Do you know where I can watch the deleted scenes, because I think I’ve never seen them..."
2021-02-02 01:48:04,twilight,They straight up look like wax figures...
2021-02-02 00:11:33,twilight,Right! Even in Barbie Charly is smoking hot!
2021-02-01 23:15:05,twilight,"Hello,

Your post has been removed because it is not strictly related to the Twilight Saga.

Thank you."
2021-02-01 23:13:27,twilight,"I'm confused; Jacob and Edward are the book (i.e. there is no narrator beyond Bella whose thoughts are unreliable in the instance). Jacob and Edward both get frustrated, even angry, with her for being so willing to sacrifice her own safety and/or happiness at various times. I feel like the only reason it sometimes comes off as not a flaw is because it's Bella's POV. Also not sure what other characters you are referring to. Beyond her selflessness when it comes to her parents, most of the other examples of her lack of self preservation are related to the supernatural so nobody but the supernatural characters would know about it. And I would argue that we see disapproval of the trait from Alice and Jasper as well. Maybe I just had a different reading experience than most but I always saw it portrayed as a bad thing that she is so willing to sacrifice everything for others. I think anytime an authors writes a character trait that the character takes to an extreme that indicates that it isn't normal or healthy (i.e. Edward's overprotectiveness)."
2021-02-01 22:47:37,twilight,"Yes! I'd rather watch a tv show of it, maybe. I made a whole comment/post about it a while back. It was basically me just describing what they should do in a Twilight tv show. I kind of merged with with the movies and how they did flashbacks in the Vampire Diaries."
2021-02-01 22:35:05,twilight,"The way I see it Edward and Jacob may have pointed it out but the book treats it as a value. Bella's sacrifices almost always work out. Other characters would be shocked about the lack of self preservation but would proceed to comment along the lines of ""you are so different from other humans"""
2021-02-01 22:22:25,twilight,I would argue that it is presented as a flaw in the book. Multiple characters point it out including Edward and Jacob.
2021-02-01 21:58:24,twilight,This is so awesome!!!
2021-02-01 21:21:24,twilight,I thought it was Jacob for a second I was like when did Jake get a mustache lmaoo
2021-02-01 21:20:40,twilight,Barbie Charlie did not need to look so good 😰
2021-02-01 21:09:48,twilight,Loving Barbie Jessica Stanley
2021-02-01 20:50:46,twilight,thank you god bless
2021-02-01 20:47:21,twilight,this is kinda what i imagined edward and B\\bella to look like when I read the books
2021-02-01 20:30:47,twilight,I would watch twilight if it was remade with Barbies.
2021-02-01 20:16:11,twilight,I want to go to there.😀
2021-02-01 19:40:54,twilight,This is so fantastic. So glad Twilight is back 🤓
2021-02-01 19:19:41,twilight,Charlie in the last pic looks like a teenager it took me so long to figure out who he was 😂
2021-02-01 19:08:12,twilight,"honestly, i think id be willing to buy a $70 movie and sit there for like 4 hours watching it if it meant that every single scene from the book was in it haha"
2021-02-01 18:59:23,twilight,26 years old and goin strong 🧛‍♂️ 🐕 👧
2021-02-01 18:52:03,twilight,I hope she at least gets to talk to her mom on the phone. Or video chat. We all know Renee hovers. It’s as if the movie just forgot about Renee
2021-02-01 18:49:53,twilight,"Go watch the actors commentary on the scenes. Not only do they agree, it’s basically comedy piece to them."
2021-02-01 18:42:25,twilight,This is giving me Robot Chicken vibes
2021-02-01 18:40:52,twilight,"Because in 20 years Bella would be almost 40 but still looks 18/19, unless they put makeup on her to age her a little."
2021-02-01 18:19:29,twilight,I want.... To see this.
2021-02-01 18:18:41,twilight,Yeah he’s Jackie’s dad!
2021-02-01 18:18:04,twilight,Wait. He’s in that show?
2021-02-01 18:08:08,twilight,I dont hate it
2021-02-01 17:51:59,twilight,i just cackled
2021-02-01 17:30:48,twilight,"
Barbie having more emotions than Bella 👀"
2021-02-01 17:30:38,twilight,"That’s fair and I agree that what we’re shown contradicts that quite a bit, but that’s what it says, straight from SM’s mouth 🤷‍♀️"
2021-02-01 17:28:11,twilight,"I've never read the official guide, but saying that completely sounds a little... Wrong. In a way they don't, but I stand by my belief that they do develop in some ways, via the experiences that they go through. I mean, Edward has his rebellious stage that he goes through and then regrets it dearly. It's stated that falling in love can cause a vampire to change, when for the most part they're very constant creatures. Basically, I half agree with what the guide says, based on what we have seen in the series (and what would make sense psychologically)"
2021-02-01 17:21:45,twilight,u/buzzybnz u/hkins1 this is so cute!
2021-02-01 17:11:34,twilight,Oof
2021-02-01 17:05:13,twilight,Bella's hair looking fab
2021-02-01 17:03:09,twilight,It’s old for YA! YA dictates that characters are no older than 18 most of the time.
2021-02-01 17:02:15,twilight,23 and 26 are not old lol 😂 that’s the thing that gets me
2021-02-01 17:01:33,twilight,"Yeah, YA conventions don't like focus on character who are too old, as evidenced by the fact that basically every YA book put zero emphasis on the parents. That's probably a large part of it."
2021-02-01 16:59:37,twilight,"It's actually stated in the Official Guide that they ""do not develop emotionally or mentally past the age at which they are transformed."""
2021-02-01 16:55:11,twilight,"Yeah this could be! When I first read the books in 8th or 9th grade, I definitely thought 23 was old lol. Even 17, for that matter."
2021-02-01 16:53:10,twilight,"I think it's honestly just because it's a YA series and YA likes for characters to be younger. When I was 13, 17 was SO old and 23 was EVEN older. 26 was basically ancient."

Thank you."
2021-02-01 16:27:13,twilight,"Yeah I agree with you - this is just how Bella is. People like what they like and that’s cool. Both mainstream and “fringe” are fine. 

I think it’s more SM’s characterization of Bella than Bella herself. IMO...Bella is...Idk. She likes reading, she’s academic, she’s clumsy, she loves her mom, she’s a caretaker...we don’t know much else about her. Then when she falls in love, it’s all about her loving Edward and wanting to become a vamp because she wants to be with him forever. To me it seems...Idk."
2021-02-01 16:22:19,twilight,That is so adorable!! And they obviously put a lot of love and work into it.
2021-02-01 16:21:48,twilight,Yeah I think it makes more sense after she becomes a vamp
2021-02-01 16:17:04,twilight,"Yeah I get that. My father is an alcoholic and my mother is the daughter of one. Not the most functional.

And yeah it’s just that she wrote Charlie like a typical “guy.” There’s nothing wrong with being a typical “guy,” people like what they like, but for me it’s more about the rhetoric and how the writing was done more so than the actual characters, if that makes sense. 

I’ve been trying to articulate that I think it’s mostly rhetoric and not actual characters that I see as an issue. The stereotypes, tropes, etc. How the narrative is written/how certain themes are handled. It’s hard for me to articulate it, I’m not a literary scholar lol."
2021-02-01 16:05:18,twilight,I imagined Jana from Wolfblood as Edythe 🤪
2021-02-01 16:04:09,twilight,"But by your definition the issue of NLOG is going too far and making it the whole personality. But Bella isn’t doing it to be different, she’s just interested in the things she’s interested in. She’s not making her whole personality around being different. Plus nothing in the books or movies or even these comments say that following the mainstream is bad and there *are* books where the protagonist is more mainstream, but that doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with characters who have different interests."
2021-02-01 16:02:18,twilight,"When I do my reread I’m going to read MS, THEN Twilight"
2021-02-01 16:00:44,twilight,"I think in MS, god I hope it wasn’t a fic or a meme, he bushes someone off like ‘Oh, the fresh mountain air is good for the skin’ ahsjfhshs"
2021-02-01 15:58:30,twilight,"""I’m not really into ideas of “fate,”"" I personally don't mind it in fantasy. I guess I'm good at separating fantasy vs real life. But I do think that is the writer's intent, I think it's specially pushed in the last book when she's good at being a ~vegetarian vamp~"
2021-02-01 15:54:03,twilight,"As far as the lack of LGBT+ representation though, it definitely sucks. SM didn’t do well with minority representation as a whole. 

I whole heartedly agree with u/angbhb333 ‘s comment but I’d like to add some more. Specifically around the codependency, blaming herself for everything and the Charlie thing.

To start off with, Bella’s not just assuming Charlie doesn’t like shopping. He’s her dad and despite their distant relationship, there are things people pick up on about their parents. Bella understands that her father is a quiet, protective but stereotypically masculine person. He doesn’t like shopping, he doesn’t like cooking and he’s not a fan of things that might be perceived as unnecessary. He’s a basic guy who (I would imagine) would be quite happy living in a cabin in the woods, away from everyone. Yes, this is how SM wrote him and yes, it’s a stereotype but it’s not how Bella as the protagonist is perceiving it. And there are plenty of other characters who don’t fall into stereotypes.

The other thing that is important to remember is that Bella basically grew up neglected. It’s not explicitly stated in the original saga and we see more of that in MS but at the end of the day, Renee is unreliable and frankly, IMO, she comes off as more interested in being Bella’s friend than her parent. So, by extension, as we saw in MS (and sometimes in Twilight), Bella was forced into a parenting role from a young age. 

Now, in more recent years, this kind of upbringing has been acknowledged as a form of abuse - parentification and neglect. This kind of upbringing forces kids into the selfless role and plants the seeds of codependency. And on top of that, can be a factor in anxiety and depression. A big factor in anxiety is believing you are at fault or worrying about how you’ve done something wrong. 

Now whether or not SM deliberately factored all of that into her writing, we’ll never really know. Although we do know from MS that she presents it so Edward is able to deduce a not fantastic home life from how caring Bella is. But at the end of the day, these flaws, traits and factors in her character are what made her relatable to many. I know that I, coming from an abusive household, saddled with parentification and now dealing with codependency and anxiety, definitely was able to connect *because* of those traits."
2021-02-01 15:49:08,twilight,"good point about thrift shops if you mean used clothes - they don't exist in Italy for some reason. but I'm still pretty sure most people don't consider shopping a hobby - neither in Italy nor my foreign friends. but for the sake of this argument, I'll just say I'm sure there are at least as many people who would spend their free time getting books to read (hopefully in the library) as buying clothes (probably in a thrift shop)"
2021-02-01 15:45:53,twilight,"He kinda said it though, that he was leaving I mean. It seemed he decided he wouldn't but yeah. doesn't surprise me, he was inclined to the whole time."
2021-02-01 15:44:43,twilight,Love this!
2021-02-01 15:37:46,twilight,"Lol haha

Idk. I’m not really into ideas of “fate,” but it’s been a while since I’ve read the books"
2021-02-01 15:36:41,twilight,"I am European, too, and we would definitely go shopping, even when we didn't have ""above average"" income - we would at least go to thrift shops. We would go to the mall every lunch break. Yes, we wouldn't spend huge amounts of money (although I knew people who would overspend their budget), but I doubt poor people in the US would either (some, of course, not everyone - credit card culture plays into that). I don't think there is such a huge difference, I think it's mostly what we see in films and tv shows, at least from what I've gathered from some US American friends/acquaintances. Definitely not unusual for girls to be expected to ""like shopping"" and lower-income families do think it's a hobby. I really, really don't think it's nowadays a US-specific stereotype. If you are talking about spending hundredths of dollars multiple times per week then sure, but that's not ""outside the US"", that's kind of unusual for anyone who doesn't have lots of money.  
As with cars, sure, not everyone has a car, I don't for one, but I know lots of people in their early twenties - from various economical backgrounds - who do own a car. Not new ones, sure, but they do have a car. It definitely varies though.  


Honestly, having a house when you're poor is a bit more US-typical to me - we don't have many cardboard houses here so most low-income people live in flats."
2021-02-01 15:33:54,twilight,Charlie can get it
2021-02-01 15:31:12,twilight,I thought it was pretty obvious she was meant to die one way or another and Edward trying to protect her was pointless. Plus her clumsiness is such a comedic relief to me lol
2021-02-01 15:17:16,twilight,Yeah that makes sense. I forget that the book is meant for teens. Reading it as an adult hits different.
2021-02-01 15:15:11,twilight,"Bella would definitely fit most of the standards for an NLOG. However, it's mostly to be easily relatable to everyone, and just because someone has a lot of the traits doesn't automatically mean they are one (and can be harmful to those who are just like that). I personally think what makes an NLOG one is the way they view the rest - the putting down of more ""typically feminine"" girls. Yes, she feels like an outsider, but she doesn't think she's better than others. Furthermore, as others have stated, Stephanie Meyer doesn't treat the other characters that way either (not generally at least) so I wouldn't think that was necessarily the purpose. I think she!s just a blank-slate character a lot of young girls can relate to easily - I certainly did as a 12-year-old."
2021-02-01 15:14:09,twilight,"I'm from Italy and I have friends in most of Europe, what I said about cars is true for them (sure many use their parent's) and same for shopping, only people with more than average money regularly go shopping for fun. one thing is finding shopping fun, another is going shopping without a reason and actually buying things on a regular basis. so you're not really correcting me, I'm pretty sure that's not the norm 🤷‍♀️"
2021-02-01 15:13:39,twilight,I'm glad you guys are enjoying it🧡
2021-02-01 15:09:03,twilight,Same here!!!
2021-02-01 14:58:16,twilight,"I mean, the movies are fine, but they could have been *soooo* much better."
2021-02-01 14:46:23,twilight,"So I’m probably going to get hate for this but I really wasn’t a fan of Hardwicke’s vision for the film. Even in the director’s notebook, she mentions how she specifically wanted Kristen to do the kissing scene on the bed because she saw her do it in another movie and wanted that vibe. But in doing so, she jumbled up other scenes to make that happen and then we ended up with the meme that is Bella saying Edward’s a vampire. It was totally inorganic compared to the car scene in the book. 

I also feels like they sucked all the wittiness out of Bella to accomodate the more dark and brooding vision Hardwicke had. She was sarcastic and witty and funny in the books but we end up with a flat Bella (who only becomes more animated in the following movies) and Kristen Stewart gets labelled as emotionless when that’s what was pretty much asked of her. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love the movie, I love that it started the series and I know that there was a limited budget but damn there are some things in the movie that are (as you mentioned) so bad that it’s funny."
2021-02-01 14:38:53,twilight,TBH that’s pretty impressive. There’s some serious dedication there and you can tell they probably hand made a lot of those tiny clothes
2021-02-01 14:37:47,twilight,that's so cute 😍
2021-02-01 14:35:34,twilight,Yep! 🙌👏😂💜💜💜
2021-02-01 14:32:37,twilight,"It's a great watch, as usual from Sara Z! Hope you enjoy ☺️"
2021-02-01 14:30:53,twilight,"That is what made me give the series a shot! I realized that it doesn’t seem like it takes itself too seriously, and it’s not at all bad like lots of people say. I giggled so hard to myself over the spider monkey line, just would burst out laughing sitting at the dinner table."
2021-02-01 14:01:31,twilight,That's why I love it. I love the characters and the dialoge is hilarious
2021-02-01 12:48:19,twilight,I'm so glad that was cut from the movies because I got so mad at Alice for going along with it and Edward for even suggesting it
2021-02-01 12:35:10,twilight,Audible is what I am using
2021-02-01 12:28:36,twilight,Thanks for posting OP! My two worlds colliding with Twilight and Sarah Z’s media criticism— so excited! I’ve bookmarked to watch after class today 🙊💖
2021-02-01 12:14:54,twilight,Where can I listen to the audio book?
2021-02-01 12:14:21,twilight,[deleted]
2021-02-01 11:56:39,twilight,Edward had no idea that Edward and Bella would learn more about biology when she got pregnant with Renesmee.
2021-02-01 11:47:32,twilight,Oh ok. Cool. Let me know if you find it
2021-02-01 11:46:49,twilight,"Yes! I can’t remember exactly where, but I’m 99% sure it’s when he’s trying to figure out if Bella is physically attracted to him or afraid of him. 

He comments that most women and a number of men, too, are initially attracted to him for his looks, scent, and other predatory lures, before they instinctively register that there is something profoundly other about him. Once they do, they get creeped out and pull back without really knowing why."
2021-02-01 11:42:53,twilight,"Oh he does!? If you find it, let me know. :)"
2021-02-01 11:42:02,twilight,"I’m not being contrary because I do agree that the books primarily feature heteronormative dynamics, but Edward actually does acknowledge that men find him attractive in Midnight Sun. It’s a bit of a throw away moment, but it does exist."
2021-02-01 11:37:54,twilight,"Oh I hadn’t heard the vampire heritage thing. Interesting. Probably wouldn’t be canon though. 

I think I enjoyed the book more as a teen - I think this is what it comes down to for me. As an adult, it still has some appeal for nostalgia/young love kind of tropes, but some of the tropes, like the blushing thing, are boring me lol because they’re so repetitive. 

And I think some of the tropes were forced a bit too much. I’ve read about Bella blushing and tripping so many times lol."
2021-02-01 11:34:47,twilight,"That could be, I just think the clumsy parts got repetitive and old. 

MS was only released a few years ago though. 

And the idea of Bella/Edward being demi is interesting. 

I know there are sexualities besides gay and LGBTQIA+ lol. I’m ace myself. 

And it wouldn’t be labeled tokenism if it was done right. Representation as tokenism applies if it’s done for the sake of representation only, or clout. They don’t have to be token characters with no character development."
2021-02-01 11:30:20,twilight,"Oh definitely, and I think Twilight gets a lot of hate for this, but most romance novels have a very very similar vibe. Beautiful girl doesn't know she is beautiful, is smart but humble, has an innocent and endearing flaw. I feel like I get what you're saying, it's not super heavy handed but it's still a big theme that Bella is different (which some people have theorized is because she has Vampire lineage in her family line somewhere??? Lmk if anyone has that link.)"
