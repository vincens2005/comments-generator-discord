2021-02-02 04:43:05,NetflixSexEducation,I don't think so they care about eachother too much that will a good point for argument between them but I would like to see that coz nobody have perfect relationship and considering fact that they both have different attitude...so it will be fun to watch their arguement as well...and of course they will make up quickly üòÇ
2021-02-02 04:32:42,NetflixSexEducation,"The bridge scene where she‚Äôs trying to kiss him, Maeve was still in a relationship with Jackson. From my perspective, I‚Äôm pretty sure Otis was just really nervous about it and he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs at the same level as her. She was way out of his league and he wasn‚Äôt sure she even liked him that way.
But when ola came around, she showed real feelings towards Otis. She was single and he was single so I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt mind kissing her. I agree that Otis was wrong for not pursuing Maeve. He was really immature for calling her out in season two as well. 
Season 3 means will see a new side to them. They‚Äôll finally grow up and mature together"
2021-02-02 04:32:32,NetflixSexEducation,"True. I think at the time of posting this post, I was recalling the time when Isaac (George Robinson) had an interview, and one of the main things he is like that he hopes the fandom accepts him for what he's done. And he wasn't exactly the viewer's favourite in Season 2, was he? And when he said that, I thought that was slightly worrying. I mean sure, a character can have a redemption arc, but how does he get redemption after the absurb-but-understandable thing that he did. I also sense that for both Maeve and Otis good things happen, but I suppose we can't really say things like that, especially when there is a chance that good things will/will not happen for them, right?"
2021-02-02 04:28:02,NetflixSexEducation,"But... that doesn't necessarily mean to say that bad things won't happen for him or for him and Maeve. But yeah I hope so too, my friend!"
2021-02-02 04:26:55,NetflixSexEducation,Yes. Exactly! Let's hope and cross our fingers. Here's a question for you: Do you think that there will be something bad that involves the 2 of them? Because... maybe that's how I see a potential season 4 happening... unless there's another way. What do you think?
2021-02-02 04:25:04,NetflixSexEducation,Yeah. Asa does. Here's another question: Do you think other characters will have a successful season?
2021-02-02 03:37:08,NetflixSexEducation,You pay way too much attention üòÇ
2021-02-02 03:33:20,NetflixSexEducation,But I think the kiss will be in season 3‚ù§Ô∏è
2021-02-02 03:23:00,NetflixSexEducation,Maybe but in E6 when Lilly was at Otis's he used his other one. So I thought maybe his one broke down and he stole his mother ones.
2021-02-02 03:15:21,NetflixSexEducation,"I believe there will be two kisses at least in season 3

One where Maeve gets caught up in the heat of the moment and steals a kiss then they will get confused and stay away for a while

And one in the end of season or when they get together where she returns it ü•∞"
2021-02-02 03:12:15,NetflixSexEducation,Unacceptable! ALL redditors have unika appliances!
2021-02-02 03:09:50,NetflixSexEducation,Maybe they both have one?
2021-02-02 02:56:59,NetflixSexEducation,Yes I don't even know why he did it because he has is own one as you can see in E6 üòÇ

2021-02-02 01:21:02,NetflixSexEducation,"Getting decent vibes from Asa at the moment.

Let's be honest - the majority of fans of sex ed are heavily invested in these two so as a result season 2 was a bit depressing.

It would surely make sense to have the two characters bounce back with a bit of happiness in season 3 and these two make eachother happy so I can only see them reconciling by the end of the season."
2021-02-02 01:03:24,NetflixSexEducation,You made a great edit my man. :)

2021-02-01 23:25:55,NetflixSexEducation,">Otis tried to ruin Maeve and Jackson‚Äôs relationship by telling him to set up a grand gesture? He‚Äôs a monster.

Who thinks that?

The problem with Otis in Otis/Maeve is that he doesn't pursue Maeve after S01E03 until the end of S02E08 and Maeve never learns of Otis's SE S1's 'sexual disfunction' but she does see Otis has no problem kissing Ola and having public PDA with Ola and Maeve does learn that Otis has no problem with drunkenly dancing with other girls and having sex with Ruby.

How should Maeve feel in S01E04 after Otis tells her to go away after she tries to 'get physical' with him? How should she feel in S01E05 after he sabotages hers trying to kiss him? And then Otis gets angry with her in S02E04 as if he somehow forgot that she tried to kiss him in S01E05 and wasn't dating anyone in S02."
2021-02-01 23:15:42,NetflixSexEducation,Amazing in fact üòÇ
2021-02-01 23:15:10,NetflixSexEducation,"Beautiful edit, I think the song couldn‚Äôt of fitted any better ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
2021-02-01 23:12:26,NetflixSexEducation,"I can definitely understand Maeve‚Äôs jealousy. It‚Äôs been shown throughout the show. However, I am mostly talking about how unfair the writers (and some fans) treat Otis. Otis tried to ruin Maeve and Jackson‚Äôs relationship by telling him to set up a grand gesture? He‚Äôs a monster. 
Maeve tried to scare ola away by telling her that Otis is a virgin which in the bridge she said she didn‚Äôt judge him for, all of a sudden you don‚Äôt hear anyone talking about that."
2021-02-01 23:12:08,NetflixSexEducation,"He's ""confused about all that sort of stuff""; otherwise, he would have kissed her in S01E03 or S01E04."
2021-02-01 23:08:20,NetflixSexEducation,"RESPONSE TO THE ORIGINAL POST AND THE THREAD:

 ;

* The reality is that Maeve Wiley wasn't actually disappointed with Otis/Ruby: she's wounded by it.

Maeve was so threatened by the idea of Otis/Ruby (even in S01E05) because of their various socioeconomic statuses.

Maeve in S02 is in the Aptitude Scheme, she's on the Quiz Heads team, etc. She's clearly university-bound. But Maeve is currently simply potential. She's still poor and still lives in a trailer park. Otis chose the daughter of a plumber over Maeve (if Maeve knows about Ola's father). And Otis chose the 'Queen Bee' of the school over Maeve. Ruby is 'rich' and Otis naturally more gravitated toward Ruby than Maeve.

And remember that Otis actually FORGOT THE DAY OF MAEVE'S FINALS. How interested does Otis seem in S02 that Maeve is trying to better herself? He actually made fun of hers dressing better in S02E02 or whenever and never complimented her on her changing her hair to look more professional. And it's not as if it's easy for Maeve to have such hair and makeup."

* I considered the Rami (sp?) thing was way overdone. He's not bad-looking for anything, but arguably Eric, Otis, and Adam are all better-looking. Arguably, Eric is better-looking than Jackson.

And we never see anyone 'pant' over Maeve or Ruby."
2021-02-01 22:54:53,NetflixSexEducation,"RESPONSE TO THE ORIGINAL POST:

 ;

* Maeve Wiley ""started to catch feelings for Otis"" in S01E03 at-latest. Maeve in S01E04 hadn't had sex with Jackson again after S01E02 until S01E04.

Maeve during the Pool Scene in S01E04 seemingly wanted Otis to ask her out.

Maeve in S01E05 seems surprised that Otis is seemingly interested in her. Maeve during the Bridge Scene tries to kiss Otis and gives him THAT LOOK beforehand.

It's clear that Maeve preferred Otis to Jackson and would have dumped Jackson for Otis."
2021-02-01 22:49:38,NetflixSexEducation,"Ola becomes concerned with Maeve when Ola senses and/or realizes that Maeve may want Otis/Maeve.

Ola probably wouldn't even be fine with Lily Iglehart if Ola thought that Lily wanted to date Otis.

Ola simply isn't as likable or interesting as Maeve Wiley and Lily. And the actor playing Ola simply isn't as good as Emma Mackey and Tanya Reynolds."
2021-02-01 22:45:56,NetflixSexEducation,"I've always reasoned that Maeve was strongly hinting that she wanted Otis to ask her out to the dance. She's purposefully standing in front of the dance poster and then draws Otis's attention to it and then asks Otis if he's going to the dance. And she did very recently try to kiss him.

And it's not as if Maeve didn't notice that Otis 'checked Maeve out' when he sees her at the dance."
2021-02-01 22:43:15,NetflixSexEducation,"Was Maeve wrong in this scene? Does the Bridge Scene in S01E05 somehow not exist?

In some ways, Maeve was probably disappointed that Otis didn't try to kiss her in S01E03 when they are in front of her house. And she feels rejected after the Pool Scene in S01E04.

And let's be honest. There is a very considerable difference in the looks and sex appeal of Maeve Wiley versus Ola Nyman--Ola is only so threatened by Otis/Maeve because of Maeve's looks (and maybe sexual experience)."
2021-02-01 22:42:45,NetflixSexEducation,omg lol. didn‚Äôt even think about that. it did seem a bit sus.
2021-02-01 22:38:34,NetflixSexEducation,">that leads people to say that Otis doesn‚Äôt deserve her when in fact Otis is the most deserving - even if it should be so that anyone shouldn‚Äôt need to ‚Äòdeserve‚Äô someone.

No one DESERVES anyone.

 ;

>Otis went behind Maeve‚Äôs back on accident and it was in the show from when he did it, to the end of the season.

I don't know to what this refers, but Maeve in S01E07 was trying to get Otis and end Otis/Ola--I'm not sure how this is considerably worse than Otis's trying to sabotage Maeve/Jackson in S01E04.

 ;

The thing with Otis is that Otis doesn't pursue Maeve after S01E03, essentially rejects her in S01E04, essentially rejects her in S01E05, clearly chooses Ola over her in S01E08 and throughout S02 to the point that he was going to end all unnecessary contact with Maeve, etc.

And there's never been a moment with Maeve toward Otis such as in S01E07 when Maeve is given that knowledge that Otis essentially made Jackson be Maeve's boyfriend for free and given paid Maeve for that with Jackson's money.

When Maeve/Jackson began, Otis and Maeve had only met that day. At-most, Otis/Maeve were beginning to have 'a thing'. In S01E03, Maeve allows Otis to turn a 'pick me up after I get an abortion thing' into a genuine date and then Otis doesn't pursue Maeve after S01E03. Etc. And then Otis in S2 has sex with Ruby instead of pursuing Maeve.

 ;

Maeve isn't perfect in the Otis/Maeve relationship, but Otis in S01 and S02 overall from her perspective finds her physically attractive and wants to be friends with her but doesn't seem to want her and after S01E08 essentially abandoned her."

2021-02-01 17:12:44,NetflixSexEducation,"we'll see these theories can only be done in my opinion after  season 3 is out and we'll have better ideas, I think an intimate scene at the end of season 3 for Otis and Maeve is practically impossible if we're lucky at the end of season 3 I think we'll have a kiss and they'll get together, then in s4 maybe in the middle or even at the beginning of the season to show some funny clips we could see them doing intimate scenes with the various couple problems they'll have for sure."
2021-02-01 17:08:28,NetflixSexEducation,That season 3 isn‚Äôt the last season
2021-02-01 17:02:44,NetflixSexEducation,It‚Äôs either the end of s3 or the middle/end of s4 with intimate scenes I think
