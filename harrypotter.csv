2021-02-03 11:14:09,harrypotter,Oh I agree with you super hard about everyone. BCJ is my fave DE and Reggie Black is so intriguing too. Will happily add Burke to the list too. And Aberforth! I wonder if there are good fanworks about those guys. Okay definitely about Regulus because he's somewhat of a fandom darling but hmmm

2021-02-02 08:12:21,harrypotter,"I once thought this aswell, but the prophecy states: ""and either must die at the hand if the other for neither can live while the other survives."" 

So I think Voldermort would have to come back one way or another and a stand off is inevitable. Maybe he would have returned weaker. Also the way he was brought back, with harrys blood true his veins. That helped Harry in the long run. He knew where Voldermort was up to. Had the elder wand etc. So maybe this benefits Harry?"

2021-02-02 08:09:53,harrypotter,"This is one of those times where I don‚Äôt particularly like Rowling‚Äôs post-publication take on things. Agree on Hermione, but Ron has similar genes to Ginny, whom she herself describes as *very* attractive. And Harry is the son of a popular, rich jock, who got the girl with beautiful eyes, and is himself the center of attention, even outside his interactions with Voldemort. Even if she never explicitly stated it, Harry is an attractive person.

And even on Hermione, it always made sense in my head that she was probably attractive; she just always had her nose in a book so didn‚Äôt bother cleaning herself up all that often."

let that sink in.

So basically I‚Äôm done here."

2021-02-02 08:05:04,harrypotter,"I think killing Nagini is in a way symbolic of Neville forging his own path despite his family's tragic history and the prophecy, while still tying in with them, whereas killing Bellatrix would have been too symbolic of revenge."

2021-02-02 08:03:25,harrypotter,"I think people dumb him down to snape bad or snape good cuz it's easier than even beginning to understand the complexity of his character. The more i read the books the more i find it difficult to imagine what it'd be like if i was in his place, and honestly i have tremendous respect for him even though there are so many ways in which he could have been better. He is the perfect example of grey."
2021-02-02 08:03:07,harrypotter,Whatever you prefer
2021-02-02 08:03:02,harrypotter,"He wasn't worse than Bellatrix in the grand scheme of things, but he was worse to Neville than the criminal who effectively killed his chance at a family.

If you had read the books you'd know that he first asks Dumbledore to hide only Lily, and then changes that to her whole family once Dumbledore is disgusted with him.

It's true he spied on the death eaters. But he still joined them and the only reason he spied on them was because of Lily and her legacy, not because he particularly had any goodness in him.

Snape might have done some good things, but that does not absolve him from the hundreds of students that he mistreated and bullied. Also, following your logic, no one honored Regulus, except for Kreacher, and he's not exactly a model member of society, so why not name the kid Albus Regulus? Or Albus Sirius? Or Albus anyone else?"
2021-02-02 08:02:28,harrypotter,Ok. I'll stop
2021-02-02 08:02:26,harrypotter,"Language is ultimately about delivering information, but very Slytherin of you to take pot shots at the delivery and not the substance of my statement."
2021-02-02 08:02:17,harrypotter,"""demeaning to people to reduce them to such one facet of their personality."" 

?

It's incredible how offended and defensive people in this thread are. I'm simply trying to work out the LOGIC pattern of this house sorting in this fantasy novel. Sometimes, in such hypothetical ponderings, one has to go to extremes. 

See my post below, where I ask how one could say that a person values wisdom over loyalty. I think this is interesting to think about, and those who don't agree, well, you don't have to."
2021-02-02 08:01:49,harrypotter,"I think she said something similar about all the main three. They were just too good looking compared to the dorkier versions she had in her head.

Perfect picks of course."

2021-02-02 08:00:28,harrypotter,"I weren't solely judging on one comment. Also it can just be interpreted as ""Jesus, start reading a book instead of only watching the movies"" which can lead to a conversation about books vs. movies which would be a lot more fun than just getting insulted by you."
2021-02-02 08:00:11,harrypotter,"I can understand why you're saying Sirius was wrong. 

But all he was left with was revenge at that time. He had suspected Lupin ( Probably because he was a werewolf who would be tired by the treatment of the society) and was betrayed by wormtail. The reason Wormtail was the secret keeper was because of him (If I'm not wrong). So, enormous guilt. This would've been reason enough to go for revenge. 

But he still thought of Harry before revenge. Once this was deprived too, all that was left was exact vengeance. 

(But the Harry part is dumb, tbh. Just because Hagrid took the child, he though he had lost him forever. Could be something I have missed or hasn't been explained or he wasn't in the proper state of mind)

Just wanted to add that, Sirius had lost everything dear to him at once, so even if that might have beem a bad decision, I don't think there was any other choice he could've taken at that point"

2021-02-02 07:58:16,harrypotter,"Sure, I find it works best when you have a basis for it though. Like ""Galleons for good art/points"" or something, rather than ""Galleons for everyone just because"" which is spamming"

2021-02-02 07:55:07,harrypotter,"So why would you say that Hufflepuffs would be killed in your scenario if your point is that everyone has the traits?

We saw what different people in different Houses did in different situations so it comes down to each person"
2021-02-02 07:54:46,harrypotter,"The requirement to kill, I feel, is 100% a moral thing. 
I dunno where, but I'm certain that it was described as the act of taking another's life was the thing that did it, instead of it being tied to magical murder or avada kedavra specifically.

Voldemort could shoot someone, or charm a guy to charm a guy to charm a third guy to hire an assassin, and that'd be enough, as long as he believed it was enough, as long as he felt he was choosing to murder another.

I think an order to kill would likely damage both the boss and the killer, as a result. It's not like the damage matters unless you've started dealing in soul magics."

2021-02-02 07:54:04,harrypotter,I don‚Äôt know why but there seems to be more of a need for vengeance of a mother over her children then a child over their parents.
2021-02-02 07:53:22,harrypotter,Revenge is a fools game. I think Neville was above that by the end of book 7.
2021-02-02 07:52:45,harrypotter,Bruh that's creepy stop
2021-02-02 07:51:23,harrypotter,"Definitely not an UO, just scroll down a bit in today's feed and you'd be able to see that. :p

People talk of Snape being redeemed because his character arc was that of a literary redemption arc. So he was redeemed--just not of everything. He wasn't redeemed of being an asshat to his students, for example, nor did he try to be. He was redeemed of what he himself saw as his biggest mistake and the thing he spent the most effort towards fixing or repaying for: Lily's death. Like I said, that doesn't redeem him for the other horrible crap, but that is what a lot of people are talking about when they speak of redemption."

2021-02-02 07:51:16,harrypotter,"Assisted suicide is through medical means only. This was more a death pact of sorts.

Also this is a fantasy story and most Catholics who read/saw the movies saw it as such (I‚Äôve had this discussion multiple times within our church group) so they don‚Äôt throw around terms that don‚Äôt apply to the story."
2021-02-02 07:50:56,harrypotter,18 year olds are still mentally children despite whatever responsibilities they may have. The brain is not fully developed until around the age of 25.
2021-02-02 07:50:22,harrypotter,"Actually two out of the three actresses that portrayed Lily have blue eyes, so they tried. They've messed up bigger things imo."
2021-02-02 07:49:47,harrypotter,"Number 1 is kind of my point here. There must be some essence in them. Something distinguishing them. What exactly would a Hufflepuff do that a Gryffindor would not, or vice versa? As an example."
2021-02-02 07:49:29,harrypotter,Happiness achieved :D
2021-02-02 07:49:08,harrypotter,Her brothers were also so adept at dueling it took 5 deatheaters to take them down. Not a stretch to think she's equally as talented and just chose to focus on raising children rather than being involved more directly in all the conflicts that take place throughout the story.
2021-02-02 07:48:30,harrypotter,"A) I still don't think there's anything bellatrix does that shows any aptitude? 

B) if we're going to base bellatrix' skill based on Voldemort being her teacher. Then we should also base Molly's skill on Dumbledore being her teacher as well. And Albus was the only wizard Voldemort ever feared. So by that logic, clearly molly wins.

C) Housewives can be bad bitches. Don't think they are less because they've chosen to be womanly. Most housewives I know could run their own business no problem. Basically, Molly's a bad bitch holding it down for 7 kids while Arthur fucks around."
2021-02-02 07:48:25,harrypotter,"I am really not sure what you‚Äôre trying to get at with all your hypothetical stuff. 

The differences in the houses and the choices they would make are basic at in the books. 

At the end when they face Voldemort‚Äôs army almost half of Gryffindor stays.  A large portion of Hufflepuff stays.  A few of the older Ravenclaws stay.  And none of the Slytherins stay. 

That kind of says it all.  It‚Äôs not that the Slytherins or Ravenclaws weren‚Äôt brave...they just realized that didn‚Äôt end well for them personally. 
Hufflepuffs stayed because of loyalty, sure.  But that‚Äôs also bravery.  
You‚Äôre trying to create a vacuum tube of only one quality and it‚Äôs actually demeaning to people to reduce them to such one facet of their personality."
2021-02-02 07:48:22,harrypotter,"I do think Sirius was wrong though. Vengeance is never the answer, and I think the books bear that out. Even Sirius who tried it was played twice by the man on whom he attempted to enact his revenge. Just because it's common to want revenge doesn't make it right. And indulging in it as a socially accepted practice breaks down actual processes of justice and criminal reform. I don't think the books get into all that, but they look at it from a moral angle and frown on it."

My sister and mother both were voracious readers and I got onto them because of that. I very specifically remember being very irritated that I had summer camp because the seventh book had just came out and I wanted to read it so badly, so this might have been... fourth or fifth grade? 

I remember watching the first few movies as well, though I can't recall if I watched or read first."

2021-02-02 07:46:11,harrypotter,"Like I said, in those scenarios they don't just relieve themselves wherever they stand but rather in a specific location. The former only happened at royal courts, one factor being that there might be too few actual earth closets or that they are too far away."
2021-02-02 07:45:56,harrypotter,"I am so lost in the point of this post for several reasons.
1. You‚Äôre reducing the houses to what you think is their one trait and assuming a whole group of people would go on way or another.
2. I think that Ravenclaw would not be the first to catch onto this. The first ones to pick up on it imo would be either Slytherin or Gryffindor in terms of how it will affect each of them. 
3. You are forgetting about the examples in canon of people that don‚Äôt fit into your scenario: Pettigrew, Slughorn, Luna
4. Hufflepuffs are loyal to fault and would absolutely fight for what is right to protect their loved ones and others

In canon we only saw Marietta turning in the DA and she was shunned so no I don‚Äôt think Ravenclaws would join anything for a ‚Äúhey at least we‚Äôll survive‚Äù"

2021-02-02 07:44:51,harrypotter,"In fairness if the magic that mad eye's eye is accessible, and bogarts are so common they can be found in your house and used in the triwizard tournament I imagine there are a few more witches or wizards who did experiments with them and saw them."
