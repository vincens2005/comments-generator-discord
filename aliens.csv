2021-02-03 11:17:28,aliens,"Canine dogsmology holds that the universe was created by the Big Bark, which constitutes both the warp and woof of Reality’s fabric….

See, a howl can encode information and act as a carrier wave. Usually it has a smooth, periodic dogscillation (a sinusoidal form, due to snout’s influence).

It’s very interesting how a bark can act as a carrier of information. The sound wave has a form distinct from the medium (air) through which it propagates...

It’s quite compelling, philosophically. Say you’re a character in an electronic software program: a “video game”. How can you know what hardware device performs the chomputations that render your world? Are you running on a Funfriendo GameSphere, a Pupstation, a Rex Box, a mobile handset device like an iPup, or even an office machine such as a photocopier? No way to know, since the program could be run on any system with suffficient chomputational capacity.

I actually learned a lot about this concept at the Hilltop Chowder School.

Stews are multiply realizable phenomena you see: substrate independent, higher-level patterns emerging from the aggregate soup-matter used in their creation. (Notice the similarity to the sound wave mentioned above.) 

Really, you and I are a sort of perpetual stew! Ingredients constantly changing out, getting chomped, getting added, leaving their flavor for weeks afterwards or longer..."

The argument is that there are some humans who operate completely in that mental space and some of those people control our world. they don't have the same concept of the value of human or animal life,  and they wouldn't have any problem destroying the environment. Those type of people are also highly manipulative and narcissistic. I think that's even more frightening than actual reptilians."

There must be some higher being(s) or forces at play here. Just like how we are the higher beings studying Petri dishes."

Depending on how advanced the alien is, they have tech that can do a lot of things, one of those things being telepathy if they have it. Of course there is also natural ability, but tech seems to be how they do a lot of things.

About what aliens look like, they don't all look the same, so they're not all going to look like grey's and one thing about aliens that doesn't matter is definitely sci-fi things. They have visited way before rise of UFO sightings or before them depicted in sci-fi.

Basically you can't just think something is fake about aliens just because it may be something similar to sci-fi is what I'm trying to say."

2021-02-02 06:22:20,aliens,"Dude almost every single claim that Bob Lazar has made can be debunked. Plus he has been caught lying about stuff like his education. For example, he claims that he had a physics and an electronic degree from Pacifica University. But Pacifica University was shut down after it was discovered that it was just an office that sold fake degrees. He was asked in an 1993 interview who his University professors at MIT and CalTech were. I don't remember their names but I know that people found out that the people he named never worked at MIT or Caltech. They were actually teachers that he had in highschool and in college were there are records of him attending. 
Something really fishy about his story is how he says that the government tried to erase his records about where he lived... But there are still records of him attending highschool and college... Yeah right.
If his story was true then why would this guy feel the need to lie about his education? Maybe because he made it all up? And claiming that the gouvernement is trying to erase his records is a way to explain how there are no records of him studying at MIT or CalTech because he never studied there."

2021-02-02 06:13:09,aliens,"One thing I think of is that if they’re telepathic, they might also be extremely sensitive to negative emotions and dark thoughts.

Elon, Area51, Zeta Reticuli....This is the basis for every childishly zany post on conspiracy forums. They just recycle the same talking points. Its way too easy to believe...

You're around a campfire, presumably in the middle of nowhere, with a select few individuals. 

Why would you not just subtly drop that you know. That's the only problem I have with this.

This makes no sense. Since when has the US ever decided to hold back technology in fear of economic collapse? We literally are a country built on doing the exact opposite. We push technology and then we use it, and then we profit. See Hiroshima/Nagasaki. 

>Elon Musk is aware but can’t say anything

lmao I eye rolled so hard at this part. If a story goes out of its way just to mention Elon for no reason you can almost guarantee its some conspiracy nut making it up.

Ugh, at this point this person just doesn’t sound intelligent. They just took talking points from a conspiracy forum (zeta reticuli, Elon, Area 51, magnetic fields) and connected them. I do not believe thier story. Too lacking in detail. Too childishly zany."

Since CE5 he seems to have flipped the script, so to speak, in regards to wanting money for knowledge. His ambassador program is $40 a month, $10 for the app, etc. I'm not concerned about paying $10 for an app, but it will limit the ability to spread the message. People need to understand that humans are a far greater threat to our survival than any outside influence from ET's. If anyone has any doubts that ETs exist and that we possess their craft they really need to do the research. Greer has compiled a phenomenal archive of material but he needs better distribution techniques. His ego and attitude during interviews is what turned me off from him."

2021-02-02 05:10:31,aliens,Yeah good point but in your example you're not using magnetism as a way of propulsion though. You are using it as a way to navigate on earth just like how modern aircraft sometimes use the earth's magnetic field for the same thing. My point was that magnetism and gravity weren't the same thing because he claimed that the ship used both to fly. But he explained in a way that made it seem as if he thought that they were both the same thing. Unless he meant to say that they use it to navigate like how you were explaining in your example.

As for why having blind faith in the good will of aliens is bad.  Well they might actually be real, and just assuming they have the best intentions is dangerous.  Is far better to be cautious in your dealings.  Especially when they ask for consent to do something.  They likely have laws, rules, government and restrictions and just consenting to everything because you assume the best can lead down a bad path.  Same as selling out the world to the first aliens we meet.  They might be the worst choice amongst many."

Race doesn’t exist from a genetic standpoint.

I think the main problem here is how information and knowledge gets dispersed to the masses. How to shake the ivory tower so that the bits may fall on the general public? 

If we are still caught up on race- not sure how we would fair when encountering something TOTALLY different. Idk"

2021-02-02 04:08:15,aliens,"Right, and typically the body dose something pretty miraculous at the end. When you are starting to transition, usually the body puts you to sleep (lots of factors affect this) and you don’t actually experience a lot of pain if any at all. Its as if the soul has already left, or the body knows its time and spares you the suffering of being awake for it. On occasion this is when the person starts to appear in other places to people. And another thing thats almost universal, theres always someone you know that is there noone else can see (usually a family member) to guide you to the next place. Death is a pretty amazing thing, it really is just a transition."

This would allow them to upgrade their military apparatus which - in turn - would enable them: when the western nations come along and demand that poorer country's natural resources at a low price, to tell those western countries to fuck off.

Please don't use ufology to confuse people about the geopolitical situation in the world today.

It's important that we understand that situation - and how the alien presence relates to it (and, most importantly, how disclosure will affect it) - but to blithely postulate that there's a race of evil aliens exploiting humanity from behind the scenes is ridiculous.

We have nothing that aliens want or need. And that statement becomes truer, and truer, with every exoplanet that astronomical science discovers.

The universe is composed of pretty much the same stuff no matter where you go in it - and it's infinite, as are the resources available.

Let's put this nonsense about our world being unique, possessing resources that aren't available anywhere else to bed for good - it's just clogging up the conversation like a thrombosis."
