2021-02-02 07:29:04,PrideandPrejudice,Also The Bennet Sisters Google Mr. Darcy AND Mr. Bingley.
2021-02-02 04:06:59,PrideandPrejudice,Also a great point
2021-02-02 04:06:46,PrideandPrejudice,"That‚Äôs very likely, good point!"
2021-02-02 01:29:41,PrideandPrejudice,*chef‚Äôs kiss*
2021-02-01 22:19:59,PrideandPrejudice,What about all the gaming debts and drunken routes and all the tradesmen whose daughters were meddled with.
2021-02-01 20:49:53,PrideandPrejudice,Omg
2021-02-01 17:40:00,PrideandPrejudice,"Googling only works if people are sharing what happened and who did it.

The internet Darcy's would still be trying to remove whatever selfies Georgiana had sent to Wickham from the internet."
2021-02-01 15:26:13,PrideandPrejudice,Dead
2021-02-01 13:57:56,PrideandPrejudice,I love that so much
2021-02-01 13:25:33,PrideandPrejudice,"He is also one of the smartest people I have ever met across the board. I always said if I needed a ""Phone a Friend"" on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire he'd be near the top of my list. He knew so much about EVERYTHING. Guessing it was because he read so much."
2021-02-01 13:22:26,PrideandPrejudice,That is incredibly high praise from an English teacher. I am inclined to agree with them.
2021-02-01 12:54:24,PrideandPrejudice,One of my high school English teachers attested that Elizabeth was the greatest character ever written and Pride and Prejudice wasn't his favorite book.
2021-02-01 11:48:23,PrideandPrejudice,Love it.
2021-02-01 11:21:18,PrideandPrejudice,Accurate and hilarious. Well done
2021-02-01 10:04:24,PrideandPrejudice,I‚Äôm going to say this kindly as I can and it is for your own sake; Get off this sub
2021-02-01 07:34:20,PrideandPrejudice,"I first read it when I was in 7th grade when my English was not that good. English is like my third language so I could understand it enough to know that Lizzie would end up with Mr Darcy but didn't understand Mr Wickham's story(I remember often confusing Colonel Fitzwilliam with him lol) . I watched the movies several years after that. Now that my English is better, I would give anything to read the book for the first time:("
2021-02-01 06:09:18,PrideandPrejudice,"Me: you know Darcy isn‚Äôt giving me psychopath vibes like at all but wHO HAS HE GOT IMPRISONED AT PEMBERLEY
Elizabeth: yeah I guess we can go visit pemberley
Me: GIRL NO DONT DO IT"
2021-02-01 06:05:02,PrideandPrejudice,"Hahahahaha yes

Just imagining watching like, ‚ÄúOk but who‚Äôs trapped in the attic and will we ever see them‚Äù"
2021-02-01 05:12:18,PrideandPrejudice,"Even though I had already watched ""Pride and prijudice and zombies""(i'd never forget myself for that) before reading p&amp;p, so I had sort of an idea that how Wickham would turn out to be but idk where did i start feeling same as elizebeth and he seemed nice to me and I actually had fell for him victim playing.  I wanted a good end for him but not with Elizebeth for sure cause How on the earth would someone else deserve Elizebth more than Mr.Darcy!"
2021-02-01 03:21:56,PrideandPrejudice,"As for Wickham, I found him quite smarmy and couldn‚Äôt quite bring myself to like him. Whilst most of his story sounded pretty legit, the bit about him wanting to become a clergyman was a red flag for me because it just seemed so unlikely"
2021-02-01 03:19:43,PrideandPrejudice,"Beep. Boop. I'm a robot.
Here's a copy of 

###[Jane Eyre](https://snewd.com/ebooks/jane-eyre/)

Was I a good bot? | [info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/) | [More Books](https://old.reddit.com/user/Reddit-Book-Bot/comments/i15x1d/full_list_of_books_and_commands/)"
2021-02-01 03:19:32,PrideandPrejudice,"I actually saw the 1995 adaptation before I read the book. I had decided that I wanted to know more about classic lit but chose to watch P&amp;P first because I‚Äôm thirstyyyy for Colin Firth lol. Thing is, I did so whilst thinking that the little I knew of the plot of Jane Eyre was actually about P&amp;P so I spent the whole series thinking Elizabeth was gonna find or become Mrs Darcy stuck in an attic..? So let‚Äôs just say I was very relieved but confused by the HEA for Darcy and Elizabeth :)"
2021-02-01 02:09:29,PrideandPrejudice,I‚Äôm not sure if it was meant to be a big twist but I was pretty certain the first time reading through that she‚Äôd come around to Darcy and he end up not being a bad guy. I can‚Äôt say much else though because I ended up watching the BBC show and the movie before I finished the rest of the book.
2021-01-31 19:37:10,PrideandPrejudice,"I think that‚Äôs what I thought, too. Thanks for commenting!"
2021-01-31 19:36:38,PrideandPrejudice,Thanks for commenting! Can totally see that perspective! Bingley and the Bingley/Jane relationship are really the catalyst I think
2021-01-31 17:55:56,PrideandPrejudice,"I actually first read the book believing that the story revolved around Jane and Bingley. Yes, I know. There was no summary or anything, and the book was an ancient copy from 1952 or something which just had a man holding out a letter to a lady on the front. I had no expectations ever and I was solely reading it because I was bored and my friend managed to smuggle it out of a library ( don't worry, it's where it belongs now). When I fist read it, I was solely on Lizzie's side. Wickham actually seemed really nice and when the big revelation came, it fell on me like how it fell on lizzie and the first readers. I actually couldn't believe it when he eloped with Lydia. But I loved Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth together anyway because of all those exchanges they have and was really happy in the end. I would love to make people read it without any foreknowledge of the plot because that just makes you feel like how Austen would have liked you to feel. Still the best book I've ever read in my life."
2021-01-31 16:39:14,PrideandPrejudice,"Ah! Don‚Äôt read any more on this sub!

I mean, obviously do what you wish and what is best but I don‚Äôt want to give any spoilers if you don‚Äôt know anything. It‚Äôs no thriller but still! Thanks for commenting"
2021-01-31 16:39:01,PrideandPrejudice,[deleted]
2021-01-31 16:07:57,PrideandPrejudice,"I think even if you have no prior knowledge you at least know that she ends up with darcy so it plants a seed of doubt in what he says so I can‚Äôt remember if I‚Äôve ever read it unbiased
Like i believed what he said but thought there must be a good reason why darcy did this"
2021-01-31 15:56:50,PrideandPrejudice,[deleted]
2021-01-31 15:56:06,PrideandPrejudice,"I‚Äôm half way through the book, it‚Äôs my first time reading it and I haven‚Äôt watched the movie, I honestly do not understand anything that‚Äôs happening, I‚Äôll have to reread it after I‚Äôve watched the movie"
2021-01-31 08:34:39,PrideandPrejudice,Thank you ( Íàç·¥óÍàç)
2021-01-31 07:35:34,PrideandPrejudice,Thanks - I appreciate you saying that! :D
2021-01-31 04:09:37,PrideandPrejudice,Sounds like someone has a school essay to write. Suggest you start by defining proto-feminism and fairytale heroine. Then identify examples of Elizabeth being both. Then discuss how it‚Äôs possible to be both (with examples).
2021-01-30 18:03:51,PrideandPrejudice,"I've watched it, I liked it okay but it could have been better üòÖ"
2021-01-30 18:00:36,PrideandPrejudice,I've seen it. I didn't know anything about bollywood...I might need to watch it again bc I didn't enjoy it
2021-01-30 17:32:59,PrideandPrejudice,"I‚Äôve seen it, it‚Äôs really funny and entertaining to watch tbh"
2021-01-29 21:54:47,PrideandPrejudice,"simply ""hey babe remember when you said i was average"" and wait"
2021-01-29 20:56:20,PrideandPrejudice,"Ok, thanks for this meme because I thought I was missing something. I was like ‚Äúgirl, he still dissed your family...‚Äù maybe she‚Äôs like ‚Äúhaha yeah, they‚Äôre weird‚Äù but I‚Äôd be pissed"
2021-01-29 11:17:46,PrideandPrejudice,That was a great point
2021-01-29 11:17:17,PrideandPrejudice,I haven‚Äôt but I do know the plot and you are so rightüòÇ
2021-01-29 11:15:34,PrideandPrejudice,"Shes saying that it doesn't matter how well you know your spouse before getting married, because you'll be married for the rest of your life and people change over time. Basically, if you marry for love now, it might not do you any good in a decade or two because you'll be different people by then. If you decide to marry for practical reasons and make the choice to be happy with your life, those reasons will still hold up over time."
2021-01-29 10:47:05,PrideandPrejudice,Anyone watch Normal People on Hulu?  This meme could easily be used for that shows main couple as well.
2021-01-29 10:45:16,PrideandPrejudice,"I remember my mom saying, ‚ÄúHow would you like a proposal like that?!‚Äù"
2021-01-29 06:39:52,PrideandPrejudice,I didn‚Äôt catch it upon first viewing but I think you are right. I‚Äôm not sure if Lizzie took it as a compliment either.
2021-01-29 06:34:48,PrideandPrejudice,i always thought that he commented on a woman‚Äôs knowledge of books because of Lizzie reading in that moment. i just interpreted as he was trying to compliment her....but he did it in a way that could be construed as something else
2021-01-29 03:01:26,PrideandPrejudice,"For me as an avid fanfic reader, it became sort of my comfort zone. Like I want something to read but I don‚Äôt want to risk reading a book where I don‚Äôt feel the chemistry between the main characters or I don‚Äôt like their personalities. I mainly read AUs so it feels like I‚Äôm reading a different novel but with guaranteed good characters"
2021-01-28 20:40:49,PrideandPrejudice,I love the detail in your design!!
2021-01-28 19:41:59,PrideandPrejudice,"If the quotes were relevant that could be cool. I know you are on here asking for advice but you know your girlfriend the best and what she would appreciate, trust your instincts!"
2021-01-28 19:32:10,PrideandPrejudice,"In the 2005 P&amp;P I love the hand flex after Darcy helps Lizzie into the carriage and touches her ungloved hand for the first time, who knew something so little and simple could be so romantic!!"
2021-01-28 19:31:11,PrideandPrejudice,"Aye
Maybe I can add my favorite quotes from different sources throughout the book?"
2021-01-28 19:30:19,PrideandPrejudice,I'm not really good at drawing.....thanks for the idea though
2021-01-28 19:26:43,PrideandPrejudice,I think what you are doing is amazing and I am sure she will appreciate what you have already done as it is! It sounds like you have done a lot to personalize the book itself so maybe you could personalize the process of giving it to her? Like trying to reenact/replicate a simplified version of a scene in the book or by quoting one of your favourite parts before giving it to her? Good luck!
2021-01-28 19:16:04,PrideandPrejudice,"I guess the reason it would inspire so much fanfic is that it is so loved by many generations for multiple reasons; it has a good message, relatable characters, great wit, etc. I love the fact that P&amp;P has so much fanfic and new takes on Austen's original story and characters as it gives me new ways to enjoy one of my favourites. In fact, it was the movie Pride and Prejudice and Zombies that got me into Jane Austen, to begin with, so yay for fanfics lol."
2021-01-28 18:34:36,PrideandPrejudice,"What's great is that is the point of the book, that he wounded her pride and she couldn't see him through any other lens - at first. Honestly don't blame her either and I would be the same way - even after reading a book about putting aside our wounded pride and prejudices against people."
2021-01-28 17:44:01,PrideandPrejudice,Thanks! Yeah I completely agree. Always find it amusing that she‚Äôs holding a book when he says that and still doesn‚Äôt realise that it‚Äôs a compliment :)
2021-01-28 17:43:32,PrideandPrejudice,[deleted]
2021-01-28 17:41:31,PrideandPrejudice,"Welcome!

I think after the ""She is tolerable, I suppose, but not handsome enough to tempt me,"" comment I don't blame her.

I get it though - later on she took the comment about extensive reading as an insult when it was really a compliment."
2021-01-28 16:31:17,PrideandPrejudice,"Trust me, you will not regret it! It is ‚Äòcapital‚Äô!"
2021-01-28 14:46:58,PrideandPrejudice,Oooh I‚Äôll need to get this. Let‚Äôs just say I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a remastered version of Colin Firth‚Äôs face can bestow :)
2021-01-28 14:39:54,PrideandPrejudice,"Don‚Äôt worry, the language used in classic novels takes a bit of getting used to for native speakers too :)"
2021-01-28 14:36:49,PrideandPrejudice,Especially by Colin Firth!
2021-01-27 23:48:32,PrideandPrejudice,Oh bless Tom Hollander and his little socks!!
2021-01-27 09:04:24,PrideandPrejudice,I found the clip here [YouTube link to video of The cast behind the scenes (Blu-ray) ](https://youtu.be/nQVOP79BuEc)
2021-01-27 08:36:08,PrideandPrejudice,I think it's on the DVD but some snippets are on YouTube
2021-01-27 08:34:21,PrideandPrejudice,What is this from? Is there a behind the scenes of the 2005 movie out there somewhere?
2021-01-24 02:55:22,PrideandPrejudice,Hotel ? Trivago
2021-01-24 01:48:15,PrideandPrejudice,A dream come true lol
2021-01-24 01:47:56,PrideandPrejudice,The perfect man doesn‚Äôt exi.....
2021-01-23 22:08:03,PrideandPrejudice,For $14.99???
2021-01-23 21:28:48,PrideandPrejudice,"Just finished watching the 2005 and I‚Äôm always so taken aback when it looks like they‚Äôll kiss in the field towards the end, but then they simply.. touch foreheads. It‚Äôs so beautiful to take things slowly."
2021-01-23 21:20:32,PrideandPrejudice,You‚Äôre welcome! I loved that I knew what you were talking about!
2021-01-23 20:44:39,PrideandPrejudice,ikr..Collin Firth thoü•∫üí¶
2021-01-23 19:12:35,PrideandPrejudice,Nothing truer ever spoken
2021-01-23 16:17:42,PrideandPrejudice,That's not in the book
2021-01-23 12:00:22,PrideandPrejudice,This was me watching the 1995 BBC scene where Elizabeth and Darcy gaze at each other while Georgiana is playing. I was like üòçüòçwow
2021-01-23 10:24:38,PrideandPrejudice,"Yup, that‚Äôs definitely out, thanks for your help!üòä"
2021-01-23 10:24:08,PrideandPrejudice,"Thank you so much, that‚Äôs it! Checking it out right now"
2021-01-23 09:10:10,PrideandPrejudice,Its out there. Google is your friend. Use the titles names given here.
2021-01-23 07:54:25,PrideandPrejudice,"Yep, but that‚Äôs only in the 2005 movie! Not the book."
2021-01-23 04:26:02,PrideandPrejudice,IMDb?
2021-01-23 03:36:23,PrideandPrejudice,The photography as well as the soundtrack are lovely in this film.
2021-01-23 02:17:29,PrideandPrejudice,"If I remember correctly, when Darcy asked what Lizzy would recommend to encourage affection, she said something along the lines of ‚ÄúDancing. Even if one‚Äôs partner is barely tolerable‚Äù a subtle roast right to his face"
2021-01-23 00:01:12,PrideandPrejudice,This is definitely the Assembly such as this trilogy. I believe the Valet and the ladies maid had fallen for each other as well.
2021-01-22 23:52:57,PrideandPrejudice,Haha I would so do that!
2021-01-22 23:18:47,PrideandPrejudice,"The first in the 3 volume set is called An Assembly Such as This by Pamela Aidan. I liked that one, too."
2021-01-22 21:45:24,PrideandPrejudice,"I‚Äôve purchased 2005 and watch it when I craft and again as a lullaby. Usually fall asleep sometime around Mr. Collins' arrival, then wake up when Lizzie is looking at the sculptures. The soundtrack is very soothing."
2021-01-22 20:08:47,PrideandPrejudice,One of my only complaints for the book is that we never saw that comment addressed. I really like JAFF that has Darcy react to that comment being overheard.
2021-01-22 20:00:26,PrideandPrejudice,"As someone who is a huge fan of both, this is on point. And now I shall think of it every time."
2021-01-22 15:49:03,PrideandPrejudice,"Interesting perspective, if I read something I like I normally search for everything else from that author."
2021-01-22 15:32:13,PrideandPrejudice,"s/o to my students who get excited to read a new book because ""now I have a new section of fanfic to explore!"""

2021-01-21 18:00:53,PrideandPrejudice,"I love this video. Especially the panicked music when Georgiana says, ‚ÄúBut my brother says you play so well!‚Äù"
2021-01-21 17:29:35,PrideandPrejudice,At least you tried cake. I'm dead!
2021-01-21 10:40:17,PrideandPrejudice,that Lego video hits different tho
2021-01-21 07:59:16,PrideandPrejudice,You know any other 2012 web series about pride and prejudice? Because if you I will totally watch it.
2021-01-21 07:04:07,PrideandPrejudice,This is referring to the Lizzie bennett diaries right?
2021-01-21 05:54:52,PrideandPrejudice,Why is this so true????
2021-01-20 20:25:29,PrideandPrejudice,I‚Äôve read in one comment that the reason for this was because touching hands in those days was equivalent to kissing of sorts. Elizabeth didn‚Äôt wear gloves compared to the others and it was forbidden for males and females to have body contact except for family. This was why Elizabeth was surprised and Mr. Darcy felt electrocuted. Like waaaahh I touched her I'm never gonna wash this hand foreveeeer
