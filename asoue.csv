2021-02-02 03:00:41,ASOUE,i‚Äôm so excited i thought this would never truly happen!
2021-02-02 01:26:25,ASOUE,Because doriyah that's why
2021-02-02 01:22:26,ASOUE,I never knew I needed this
2021-02-02 01:03:22,ASOUE,Why...
2021-02-01 20:21:03,ASOUE,Thanks
2021-02-01 19:14:12,ASOUE,I was very confused because I got Dumbledore and Ganondorf mixed up
2021-02-01 17:30:26,ASOUE,VFD is everywhere...
2021-02-01 16:17:59,ASOUE,Best post here
2021-02-01 14:40:31,ASOUE,"Thank you u/stanchfi !! They came in real quick. The second I got the notification I ran outside in no shoes for them. I also like the stamp you put on the receipt. Absolutely hilarious!

2021-01-31 20:44:42,ASOUE,"Hahhaa I was thinking me for Lemony lol. He seems like he thinks he can outsmart others and I kinda feel that way occasionally as well. 
I think maybe Ellington could have one
I‚Äôve always imagined Moxie as American"
2021-01-31 20:22:09,ASOUE,"I really want it. I wish I was an actress, though. I could soooooooo pull off Moxie!

Random question: Does anyone else ever imagine Moxie or Ellington with a british accent?"

2021-01-31 13:20:04,ASOUE,Lol I‚Äôm not
2021-01-31 13:00:54,ASOUE,lol if you‚Äôre the same person who posted that you weren‚Äôt really into the books a couple days ago then that‚Äôs so lovely to hear
2021-01-31 10:24:52,ASOUE,"It‚Äôs my favorite book series and I‚Äôm in my 20s, no shame! I really hope there is a tv series for it."
2021-01-31 08:51:05,ASOUE,"I read ATWQ in my twenties too, there is no wrong age for Lemony Snicket!"
2021-01-31 08:50:31,ASOUE,I wasn't expecting it to get teased in the show but it was! I hope so too.
2021-01-31 08:02:24,ASOUE,Various sites. They all seemed reliable. One was called CBR and their stuff is usually pretty legit.
2021-01-31 07:56:51,ASOUE,omg where did that come from?!
2021-01-31 07:25:38,ASOUE,"Yes, but I hope it‚Äôs animated in Seth‚Äôs brilliant art style."
2021-01-31 06:46:07,ASOUE,"I really hope they do eventually, I was thinking the kid that plays Five in The Umbrella Academy could be a great young Lemony, he's got the whole ""acts older than he looks"" thing down perfectly. But he's already older than the character so I don't see it happening with him in the role."
2021-01-31 05:16:55,ASOUE,I think the show is great.
2021-01-31 05:16:12,ASOUE,"There's rumors that netflix is doing one, actually"
2021-01-31 04:06:22,ASOUE,Wow a really fucking spam
2021-01-31 04:04:22,ASOUE,No - at least Joe Tracz doesn't know anything about it just as DH or BS
2021-01-31 00:30:22,ASOUE,"I hope they are doing one. 

They teased it A LOT in the show, especially Season 1, so I'm hopeful. I wouldn't expect it soon, because of covid. I wouldn't be surprised if its announced jb 5-7 years and takes 8-10, seeing as hoe unpopular the show was, but it is still something people where VERY excited for  I believe thier main problem was marketing.  If they advertised it more, it probably would have been more popular."
2021-01-31 00:09:59,ASOUE,"I started with the first book in my elementary school for a class assignment. It looked big to me back then. I believe reading the second and third in middle school. Then I stopped because I was in a stupid phase where there was apparently no time to read. Then, in high school, I had gotten out of PE lectures cause they were on sensitive topics of the body and whatnot and I told my mom sign a form so I didn‚Äôt have to be there. Apparently I was the only who had it signed so I got to spent the entire rest of the semester in the library for the longest class of the day. Ah good times. Anyways after finishing my homework, I would go around the library and I found the entire series. So I finished books 4-13 all in that library. Still my favorite series to this day. One of my best experiences of high school"
2021-01-30 18:54:48,ASOUE,"My sister and I used to collect the books from around 2003. I would get the even numbers and she would get the odd numbers. We never read them though, we just liked collecting them. Then the film came out, and maybe a year after its release we watch it on DVD, so that would have been 2005 ish. I loved the film and started reading the books from Miserable Mill, and kept collecting the books from there that we didn‚Äôt have. It was only about 5 years ago we hunted charity shops for the missing first 3 we didn‚Äôt have (every time we re-read the books, we used to read the first three in this big 3-in-1 book). My sister found both the odd ones, and finally I found The Reptile Room which completed our collection after so many years. ü¶Ñ"
2021-01-30 17:21:59,ASOUE,"Thank you, I'm sure I will! I plan on rereading them eventually as well."
2021-01-30 17:21:53,ASOUE,I started reading them when I was 7 and are still my favorites to this day üòä
2021-01-30 17:20:18,ASOUE,"I was in 3rd Grade. A fellow classmate was reading them and he said they were really good. I got him one for his birthday and decided to get one for myself too. At first, I thought they were kind of disturbing, but then I realized that I read them quicker than he did and we had an unspoken race to finish the series (I was checking them out from the school library). At the end of the school year, I was on page 111 of the grim grotto (ikr) and, sadly, he quit reading them. I had grown to love the dark humor, and decided to buy them all at a  used book store. They are now my favorite books EVER!!! (I‚Äôve read them 8 times)."
2021-01-30 16:06:50,ASOUE,2016 freshman year of HS. Got a library card just for that series. 4-5 years later and that library is one of my favorite places but I‚Äôm not allowed inside due to covid
2021-01-30 15:50:31,ASOUE,"About once every two weeks, give or take...  


though I actually started when I was the ripe ol' age of 10. So probably 2002? 2003?"
2021-01-30 15:40:17,ASOUE,"I remember finding 'The Wide Window' in a library book sale, about 2002-3, must have liked it enough to read the rest from the same library but I read them all in a completely whack order!"
2021-01-30 15:28:32,ASOUE,"My uncle bought me the first in 2001, and then once he's gone home to London, he sent me the next one.... Or so he thought. I received The Slippery Slope as my second foray into the series, and to this day it is still my favourite. I read them entirely out of order between 1 and 10, amazing experience! 11, 12 and 13 were sequential because they hadn't been released before I'd finishes collecting the rest of the series!"
2021-01-30 15:17:31,ASOUE,"2007. I was 8, so 3rd grade"
2021-01-30 15:14:18,ASOUE,"I started reading them in 4th grade, so like late 2007, maybe early 2008. I got lice real bad in 4th grade, and what I did while my mom picked through my hair was read them out loud. I know we were into book 4 just during the time we were picking, and I finished the series by 5th grade. I would love to go back and read them, but unfortunately my dad‚Äôs cats got to them and several of my copies are ruined."
2021-01-30 14:35:57,ASOUE,First read The Reptile Room on a plane or something around the time it came out.  Read the series for real about fifteen years ago.  Now I have a tattoo of an eye on my ankle--which is unfortunate since I have a unibrow...
2021-01-30 14:19:40,ASOUE,"I received the 1st 2 books in 3rd grade. Bought the 13th book when leaving for a road trip in 5th grade, without having read anything in between.  I‚Äôve since corrected that error, but since the last book is removed from the ‚Äúmain‚Äù plot, it worked perfectly fine!"
2021-01-30 10:56:47,ASOUE,"I started reading them when I was a teenager buying them for my younger sister. I was a bad gift giver though because it was definitely more my sense of humour than hers.

Speaking of which I love the Deja Vu joke from ""The Carnivorous Carnival""."
2021-01-30 10:46:42,ASOUE,[deleted]
2021-01-30 10:13:54,ASOUE,"I walked out of the shower and my sister was watching the Netflix show. We watched the entire first season. I believe I was in sixth grade. It than took me 3 years to read them all. I am sophomore now. So, I was like 11?"
2021-01-30 08:41:49,ASOUE,"I read them in the begining of last year, it took me 67 days."
2021-01-30 08:07:42,ASOUE,"I honestly don‚Äôt remember but I was probably in 2nd or 3rd grade (2009-2010) and I read the first few before my mom started buying some of the audiobooks so we could all listen, and we got obsessed with those. 

I remember one time we listened to the first three on a road trip and it was the middle of he night by the time we got to Wide Window and as we got to the Hurricane Herman part it started pouring rain outside, which was VERY cool."
2021-01-30 07:44:00,ASOUE,"When I was 7. I specifically remember having to wait days for 'The Slippery Slope' to arrive at the bookshop, and reading them in the car in the dark, lit only by the street-lamps."
2021-01-30 07:03:03,ASOUE,"I started reading them as a mental break from biochemistry when I was in college in 2002. I have started reading them again, and it's very true- it hits differently every time."
2021-01-30 06:45:50,ASOUE,"I agree! Although they're geared for kids, you can get even more out of them when you're a little older."
2021-01-30 06:44:25,ASOUE,"I have no idea when I started but I do know ""The End"" came out my first year of college. Yeah, I left my friends to pick up a kid's book at midnight and stayed up all night reading."
2021-01-30 05:45:28,ASOUE,funnily enough I finished the series on that very week.
2021-01-30 04:45:47,ASOUE,I just think it‚Äôs a good series to reread all stages because each time you can relate in different ways
2021-01-30 04:44:32,ASOUE,"But yeah I get you some themes I understood because the books overall are written for children but there‚Äôs a few tidbits in the books that when you read as a adult they‚Äôre a little clearer

One of the books overall theme is children are smarter than we give them credit for and adults can be dim. So there‚Äôs something amazing about reading this particular series as a youth and a adult and relating in different ways both times"
2021-01-30 04:41:19,ASOUE,I mean comprehension is part of reading level. Only thing I truly remember not noticing as a kid was how often Olaf murdered people. I guess when I was a kid the Orphans stories more captivated me and Olaf seemed more silly but as a adult rereading he seemed more ominous.
2021-01-30 04:36:54,ASOUE,"Yeah but I don't mean in terms of reading level, more in a sense of grasping the messages the series brings, you know?"
2021-01-30 04:35:24,ASOUE,"I have read it as an adult üòÇ
Or do you mean like years from now I reread it? I plan on doing that"
2021-01-30 04:11:59,ASOUE,"Definitely around 2004-2006 I know I started before the last book came out because I had to wait on that one. 


I also remember asking my mom either what Penultimate meant. I think it was penultimate anyway, and she told me it wasn‚Äôt a real word.  And I just trusted that. And for years I just assumed it was a made up word. It could‚Äôve been Ersatz but I remember seeing a Gilmore girls episode with ‚Äúpenultimate ‚Äú in the title and thinking back to this moment and questioning everything lol. 


Whatever the word I just wish she had honestly told me she didn‚Äôt know and I would‚Äôve just looked it up...."
2021-01-30 03:53:23,ASOUE,I hope you‚Äôll enjoy them the rest of your life! I‚Äôve reread the series many times!
2021-01-30 03:52:54,ASOUE,You should reread as a adult it hits different every time
2021-01-30 03:52:27,ASOUE,I had a high school reading level when I started reading it so I understood and have reread many times in my life
2021-01-30 03:32:53,ASOUE,"I had read the first three in High School in 2016 or 2017 (not sure) and only retook the series last year (20yo). Unfortunately I took very long to read it, but in a way it was good, cause I don't if I'd be able to grasp the whole of the complexity of the series when younger"
2021-01-30 03:21:02,ASOUE,"I started reading about two years or so ago. I found the first 4 books at a book exchange and got the rest later. I had no idea about the series but I thought the summary on the back was interesting so I got them. Now this series is one of my favorites ever. I like to take my time with books, though, so I only just now finished The End."
2021-01-30 00:48:05,ASOUE,"I started reading it in 2006, I was 12 then. I read the first three from my public library, and as they didn't carried the whole series I got it for my 13rd birthday."
2021-01-29 23:48:14,ASOUE,I KNEW THERE WAS A REASON I LIKED HIS HANDLE
2021-01-29 23:11:54,ASOUE,"I was in 4th grade, in 2002! We started with the audio books, so I immediately was hooked onto The Gothic Archies as well as the books themselves."
2021-01-29 21:45:41,ASOUE,"I started reading them on the 18th of February 2020, surprisingly great series."
2021-01-29 19:17:13,ASOUE,Oh never mind you‚Äôre a prick lmao
2021-01-29 19:11:33,ASOUE,They do not find their parents
2021-01-29 19:06:11,ASOUE,"The Eratz Elevator was always my favorite

I think I liked it so much because that‚Äôs when the format changed 

I also remember specifically pretending to be violet in my room and going into my closet aka elevator to save my ‚Äúsiblings‚Äù (keep in mind I read these books very young so I wasn‚Äôt a teenager pretending to be violet, I think I read book 6 in 4th grade)"
2021-01-29 17:04:47,ASOUE,"Poe is a better fit for Lawful Neutral due to his strict adherence to codes, legal or honorable. Love of inane paper work, his very strict interpretation of the will, and hell even the fact that he was going to let Captain Sham take the kids because it was in Josephine's will shows Poe is prone to taking a very literalist approach and following it through to the end, good or bad. Snicket is not a bad choice though given he sticks to his principals good or bad. I'd argue Justice Strauss is the closest thing to lawful good though."
2021-01-29 15:20:12,ASOUE,He's one of us.

Hope you and your unamusing humour are happy now"
2021-01-29 07:15:37,ASOUE,"It‚Äôs a joke, a word which here means I was making a clever cultural reference that went over your head."
2021-01-29 06:51:05,ASOUE,"Nice of you to meddle in others' business and ignoring the rest of the info except the thing you wanna troll about, I guess you confused me with yourself when typing this, since you are the kid here, maybe try to care about yourself first and not being passively agressive dude üíñüíñüíñüíñ"
