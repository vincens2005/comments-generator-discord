2021-02-02 08:08:27,conspiracytheories,"I completely understand what he was trying to say and my mum got me vaccinated throughout my childhood and I don‚Äôt have no problem with that. I don‚Äôt know if the ones I had were made from Bill Gates‚Äô company or not but I don‚Äôt really care anyway and I do think they are a good thing because most of, if not all western countries are free from diseases that used to kill people off easily which is a good thing. 

My main issue is with the new Covid vaccines getting rolled out because no one knows what the long term implications are with these injections, that‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm against them and if people want to take it it‚Äôs up to them but I can fully understand why his comments have been linked to all these conspiracy theories, especially after he fucked up a load of African people with his vaccines. Another thing that makes me think this Covid vaccine could be suspect is because at the beginning of the pandemic I watched a Bill Gates interview live on BBC News where he said that no one has simulated a global pandemic before even though Bill Gates himself joint funded a pandemic simulation in New York towards the end of 2019 and just before covid."
2021-02-02 08:08:26,conspiracytheories,"I have a very clear, very fond memory of my dad telling me about the name *-stein* and how it's often a Jewish name. his mom - my grandmother - was Jewish and there wasn't a lot of Jewish people where I grew up so it felt nice to have that, you know? I still get so angry when people tell me I'm just remembering it wrong, or that as a child I misread it."

2021-02-02 07:49:05,conspiracytheories,Lol no. Though I think he mentions that he shared a name with the airplane guy once or twice. He interviews a wide range of topics and people from government conspiracy to UFOs to to near death experiences. From people who sound credible to those who sound batty and he truly tries to get to the bottom of every single story.
2021-02-02 07:48:15,conspiracytheories,"I kind of think the same. As an example, in 1800s England, there were a lot more births for every family compared to two centuries later. This is because, as you said, if they vaccinate, they (the children) wont die as early due to vaccination and healthier populations. So, if nations in Africa go through the same process, there will be less children born so the rate that new babies are born each day would decrease to a point possibly below the rate of death each day, therefore the population would decrease. Also, Bill Gates wording is shit and he should test his vaccines WAY more.

Let‚Äôs think about Mandela, we all thought he died in the 80‚Äôs, then he became a leader. What if someone went back in the 80‚Äôs before and saved Nelson before he was supposed to die? This makes so much more sense to me then government mind control."

As for the Republican voters who stormed the Capitol and livestreamed their sedition, well, isn't it at least plausible that they're fucking morons, too?

Like, if you had to pick: (1) the rioters were secret ANTIFA agents who were sacrificed by the baby-eating Democrats and sentenced to years in prison for a false-flag coup to make Trump look bad after he'd already lost and it didn't matter *OR* (2) they're just stupid.

The real conspiracy here is among conspiracy theorists, who seem to be refusing *en masse* to acknowledge the failings of Trump, Republican lawmakers, and their supporters. It's disturbing."

2021-02-02 02:50:45,conspiracytheories,"Especially with spelling stuff like this or Froot Loops. That's not even memory, that's just your mind not looking closely at a logo and autocompleting what it thinks should be there. Once your mind becomes convinced something *should* be a certain way, it tends to ignore all evidence to the contrary unless it has a reason to reexamine it. 

For instance, if you ask a given person about the road signs they pass in their car every single day, what color they are, there's a good chance they'll claim that the yield signs on their commute are yellow and black when in reality they're red and white and have been for decades. They didn't fall into an alternate dimension the moment they were told that yield signs are red and white, they just never paid enough attention to the signs they see literally every day to break the preconceived notions that we've had since childhood of the way signs should be. It's the same way with this shit; the first time you read Berenstain you skim it and put an ""e"" in because that feels right, and then never looked closer."
