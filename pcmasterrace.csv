2021-02-03 11:17:36,pcmasterrace,I would drop $50 for a better cooler
2021-02-03 11:17:32,pcmasterrace,Too expensive where I live
2021-02-03 11:17:29,pcmasterrace,I'm having trouble finding one like that for cyberpunk 2077
2021-02-03 11:17:29,pcmasterrace,and then sold the time machine for the 9990x!

2021-02-03 11:17:17,pcmasterrace,Redux right?

2021-02-03 11:16:57,pcmasterrace,good luck!
2021-02-03 11:16:56,pcmasterrace,Did you see the benchmarks of the pc version of 1650 ? Also 1650 is trash in pc not worth buying rather buy a super one. They have a very huge difference
2021-02-03 11:16:42,pcmasterrace,80 degrees is normal under full-load

2021-02-03 11:16:30,pcmasterrace,"No, those just comes without vibration dampeners and low noise adapters but other than that it's the same fan."
2021-02-03 11:16:26,pcmasterrace,Hard part is fitting gpu prices
2021-02-03 11:16:24,pcmasterrace,"That's a super ambiguous topic, lol.

Personally I like the Corsair Crystal 570x if I was going to build a new machine, it's expensive but I like the all-glass look with RGB and Corsair seems to do it better than most, since the airflow in the case isn't choked."
2021-02-03 11:16:21,pcmasterrace,I'm not an audiophile either
2021-02-03 11:16:20,pcmasterrace,"Nicer setup than the one above yours when sorting by ""hot"". At least some thought went into yours whereas the other one is a Walmart desk, a keyboard, a monitor &amp; a headset.

Edit: &amp; a lamp ooooOooOoo"
2021-02-03 11:16:18,pcmasterrace,"and I'm not a huge fan of RGB parts so I don't need any of those, but if the parts that are picked have RGB then that's fine by me."
2021-02-03 11:16:08,pcmasterrace,Oh boy I bet you want to just take the rest of the day off haha. Enjoy that bad boy man!
2021-02-03 11:16:07,pcmasterrace,Chill out. Literally.
2021-02-03 11:16:01,pcmasterrace,Aa the cat is so cute!
2021-02-03 11:16:00,pcmasterrace,Thanks! Doesn't matter to me what other people wanna use as long as I love it!
2021-02-03 11:15:59,pcmasterrace,You don't say? Have any idea of this Friday might be an opening?
2021-02-03 11:15:53,pcmasterrace,"I know, just saying, if u give up the wireless u can just buy a studio headphone thats also openback for better ""3d"" sound, more comfortable, and same price, to me it look dumb."
2021-02-03 11:15:53,pcmasterrace,9900k is a top notch cpu and is an overkill unless u go 4k and even at 4k it still is a beast with no compromise
2021-02-03 11:15:52,pcmasterrace,Do you mean a graphics card? Sure.
2021-02-03 11:15:50,pcmasterrace,Im too scared to take of the bottom

2021-02-03 11:15:21,pcmasterrace,"Yes, I‚Äôm going for a mid-higher range build on ¬£1000 ($1360)"
2021-02-03 11:15:12,pcmasterrace,"Woah, woah, woah. Slow your roll man. They just announced black fans. They need at least another five years to make RGB fans."
2021-02-03 11:15:11,pcmasterrace,That‚Äôs really litüî•
2021-02-03 11:15:11,pcmasterrace,"Oh, okay, thx for answer, I guess I have to invest in better cpu and motherboard, probably even ram I guess... :("
2021-02-03 11:15:06,pcmasterrace,"Nice cases but damn are they overused now... 

Great build though!"
2021-02-03 11:15:01,pcmasterrace,Found the bedrock user
2021-02-03 11:14:57,pcmasterrace,"Actually, Ive had it for like 4 and a half months and nothing has happened to it yet, I love it, looks so good, performs so good. it does get pretty hot tho but Im ok"
2021-02-03 11:14:49,pcmasterrace,In my case its probably true.

2021-02-03 11:14:30,pcmasterrace,I've already got a VR headset and I'm not including peripherals in the budget since I've already got most of those sorted out so I'm just looking for PC parts. I know I'm going with AMD for the CPU but I don't know what I should get for the other parts though.

2021-02-03 11:14:13,pcmasterrace,"Thats cool, what are the specs?"
2021-02-03 11:14:07,pcmasterrace,No such thing as too much airflow
2021-02-03 11:13:59,pcmasterrace,There are many good cases. Is there some budget you need to be under?
2021-02-03 11:13:55,pcmasterrace,"... yea? It's always been this way, its just usually supply is higher so it's not a noticeable problem. Miners are eating the supply, so it's more in demand, so people with more negotiating power (PC system integrators) are able to get things first."

2021-02-03 11:13:33,pcmasterrace,"Congratulations, friend! Cyberpunk on low is still cyberpunk."
2021-02-03 11:13:33,pcmasterrace,"Intel wouldn't be any better if you would be using a psu with 650w for those specs. Even the gpu has a recommended 750w. So depending on what else is in your pc I'd recommend at least 850w to be safe.

See, I don't wanna offend you but you simply got a problem in your setup."
2021-02-03 11:13:27,pcmasterrace,"It might be if you have good airflow. 

It can get loud though. I'd recommend even a cheap tower cooler like a 212 if you care about noise."
2021-02-03 11:13:25,pcmasterrace,While playing games it‚Äôs around 50-68
2021-02-03 11:13:07,pcmasterrace,No. Did you spin the fans up to a million RPM when you cleaned it? Because that will damage the fan blades or bushings/bearings.
2021-02-03 11:13:07,pcmasterrace,Good luck
2021-02-03 11:13:06,pcmasterrace,I have a keyboard and it's a Drop keyboard !
2021-02-02 08:03:20,pcmasterrace,"Looks good! Don't forget to update the bios on the motherboard and enable xmp/docp to make sure your RAM is running at the advertised speed.

You can use [https://www.userbenchmark.com/](https://www.userbenchmark.com/) to see how your build is performing compared to similar builds. This will help identify any potential problems."
2021-02-02 08:03:20,pcmasterrace,Phanteks a400!
2021-02-02 08:03:18,pcmasterrace,Ok thx! The integrated HD graphics don't suport 144hz. That means it isn't defect!! I'm waiting for my new pc so it would work on that/those graphics card HDMI slot(s).
2021-02-02 08:03:01,pcmasterrace,"Yes, but it's not transfering to your new motherboard. You can transfer it to your new drive though. You can connect your new drive to your old PC, then use software like Macrium Reflect to clone your boot drive to the (intended) boot drive of your new PC.

However, when getting a new full system, it's recommended to do a fresh install of Windows. You can then connect your drive from your old PC and just copy over the files."

2021-02-02 08:02:50,pcmasterrace,Fair enough.
2021-02-02 08:02:47,pcmasterrace,"CPU,GPU,monitor details plz and did you try a second cable?"
2021-02-02 08:02:43,pcmasterrace,This is so perfect lol
2021-02-02 08:02:43,pcmasterrace,"Because I work and game ideally I was trying to aim for a 5800x (wanted at least 8 cores, but a 5900x was too expensive) but at the time I couldn't get any stock at all. A 5800x is easier for me to get now in the U.K but I mean honestly my budget is basically nothing right now haha. Plus I think going from a 3900xt to a 5800x won't be a big enough difference in 1440p gaming to warrant the upgrade now, maybe down the line though for sure."
2021-02-02 08:02:40,pcmasterrace,Just put your finger into the socket. No need for a wrist strap :-)
2021-02-02 08:02:37,pcmasterrace,"Well it‚Äôs a very long list but I will state the obvious ones:

- In order to prevent frying the electronics with built-up static electricity, people usually wear anti static bracelets and attach a metal clip to the bracelet and the other end goes into a metal part (usually the power supply) where the electricity can be safely transferred to. This stupid mofo just puts on a bracelet and nothing else is attached to the bracelet which is why people call it the ‚Äúlivestrong‚Äù bracelet.

- you don‚Äôt assemble a PC with a swiss army knife screwdriver. That‚Äôs very obvious and I it don‚Äôt think needs any explanation.

- processors usually come with a pre applied thermal paste to prevent overheating. Though the amount is controversial, usually, only a few drops of paste should be more than enough. Well, apparently it‚Äôs not for this person and he proceeds to empty the entire thing on the CPU which is a problem.

- with memory sticks, you should place them with an empty slot in between (either the 1st and 3rd slot or 2nd and the 4th slot) so you can get more performance out of them. Let alone the spacing, this stupid mofo put the ram stick the wrong way and broke it (which I think was replaced prior to booting by people who actually know PCs) 

That‚Äôs just a few examples and you can find much more online"
2021-02-02 08:02:32,pcmasterrace,"Oh wow I didn't know Chrome had it's own task manager, as I look at it I'm up to 2.2GB with only 1 extra tab.

Looks like ""GPU Process"" adding another 50% memory usage on top. Is this from hardware acceleration?"
2021-02-02 08:02:23,pcmasterrace,"Gracias! Si, yo le he quitado el cojin de la cabeza, es bastante incomodo."
2021-02-02 08:02:19,pcmasterrace,"In that case, forget what I said! Hard to tell but upon further inspection I can vaguely see the illumination. Trying to replicate this myself but current rocking a black and white build with an MSI ventus 3x cause its all I could get my hands on at my local Microcenter after camping out for a few weeks. Mad props!"
2021-02-02 08:02:17,pcmasterrace,Dude! That's awesome! You should make them so that the fans are also powered through usb.
2021-02-02 08:02:08,pcmasterrace,"Sata m.2 thing is normal as it‚Äôs to do with number of PCI lanes available, it can‚Äôt just magic up more so borrows some when you decide on a config. All you need to do is not put an NVME M.2 SSD in a SATA M.2 slot."
