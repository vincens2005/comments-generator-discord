I fucking adored kotor 2."
2021-02-03 11:16:12,StarWars,What are you talking about? It‚Äôs doing amazing and currently has 93% rotten tomatoes. I don‚Äôt know anyone who isn‚Äôt loving it.

2021-02-02 08:18:46,StarWars,Wouldn't it have been easier just to ask Leia to teach her? Or ask Luke who else is still alive and go and find them instead?

2021-02-02 08:11:47,StarWars,"I wondered that the ATATs in this film were largely unaffected by snow speeders weapons (there's one that maybe blows up due to a snow speeders shot, after it's collapsed). But in Rogue One, the ATATs there are pretty much instantly taken out by X-Wing lasers.

Granted in R1 you can see the ATATs are probably mostly for industrial cargo purposes and Veers' troops most likely had military grade equipment.

But without much contextual explanation, my reaction at R1 was more like ""oh... guess *that* just happened then..."""

Another thing is of the prophecy being a one and done thing, who says there can't be multiple Chosen Ones who take down the Dark each time it rises? Such as whoever drove the Sith into hiding before the prequels."
2021-02-02 08:09:02,StarWars,"That was great, amazing how realistic it looked.  Except for that one snowspeeder plummeting into the ground inverted -- that shot *never* looked right, the explosion doesn't line up."

2021-02-02 08:08:09,StarWars,I mean it's pretty obvious she gets down on one knee and buries the sabers at the only physical home left of the Skywalkers on the planet that their story kicked off on. What else would it be. Not really hard to inference that.

2021-02-02 08:05:31,StarWars,My most recent one that I made. I learned how to make the blade more white-ish and it looks so much better than a singular color.

2021-02-02 08:04:57,StarWars,"Read the ROTS novelization. It‚Äôs very good and gives you a lot of context on Anakin‚Äôs thoughts. If you don‚Äôt like reading, then you could watch [this](https://youtu.be/q8c5hKyThu4) 10 minute video which is a narration from the novel thet highlights the good parts and helps you understand Anakin more. I would still reccomend reading he novel because, not only is it highly praised, but it‚Äôs the best movie-to-novel adaptation of a Star Wars movie. The 10 minute video alone doesn‚Äôt do the movie enough justice, the full novel is a masterpiece."
2021-02-02 08:04:43,StarWars,"I'm not sure Boba would be down with that though.

Dave has an almost equally good chance at winning. Yoda, Vader, and Grevious all on the same team? Yikes.

Sorry Sasha... I'm gonna have to disagree with your assessments of Rey and Kylo's abilities. Neither one of them was fleshed out in any way that would give us any verifiable, hard data. They're still solid choices, and powerful, but I think you got the lesser of the offered force users from the pool. That being said, if all the force users and Grevious are off the field? You've got a decent shot at winning. Han &amp; Chewie should never be underestimated."

2021-02-02 08:02:15,StarWars,"I kind of agree with this, but I also don‚Äôt. TCW fleshed his heroic side out and it gave him more reason to leave the order, but nothing super solid. I think the ROTS novelization actually does the job better than TCW, but both pieces of media, when combined, makes Anakin‚Äôs fall more tragic."
