2021-02-03 11:17:25,gaming,"Part of the code is a memory address, and another part is a value.

You're pretty much just setting values in memory to specific values.

For instance to start with more lives you're essentially finding where that value is stored and changing the value to a higher number."
2021-02-03 11:17:08,gaming,oh i dodged that bullet rofl
2021-02-03 11:17:06,gaming,I had a guy yelling at me the other night cause it showed I have a mic but I wasn‚Äôt talking to him. Jumped on the mic and said ‚Äúwell I guess I can mute you and not worry about it.‚Äù Muted him and he quit out of the lobby.
2021-02-03 11:17:05,gaming,"Instead of criticising a teammate, help them instead. Learn to communicate in constructive ways so that you can win as a team rather than just being insulting. 

If your only way of communicating with your team is ""criticising"" them (which I suspect is more just insulting them) then they're never going to do whatever you suggest. They'll just dig in their heels and you'll get more tilted."
2021-02-03 11:16:53,gaming,What you do in your safe place is your business
2021-02-03 11:16:50,gaming,He‚Äôs trying to blend in. Jumping would definitely make you stand out in a crowd
2021-02-03 11:16:40,gaming,"This looks awesome! How much will it be when it comes out? Not like it matters, it looks incredibly fun!"
2021-02-03 11:16:38,gaming,Quiet enjoying it does sound about right...
2021-02-03 11:16:32,gaming,What's lol?
2021-02-03 11:16:31,gaming,"Where, how?"
2021-02-03 11:16:26,gaming,"I hear you, The SNES was a true classic, those games are still amazing today! So many great gaming memories, also in retrospective '94 was an amazing time as a kid. I'm thankfull i have had the opportunity to experience all the generations of gaming and not planning on stopping anytime soon."
2021-02-03 11:16:23,gaming,Thinking about it I could understand that. It took me a couple tries to actually get immersed in it
2021-02-03 11:16:18,gaming,Thank you :)
2021-02-03 11:16:14,gaming,"When you join a lobby in Sea of Thieves and hear some kids arguing:

2021-02-03 11:16:13,gaming,Cities Skylines is a fairly safe bet.
2021-02-03 11:16:03,gaming,Definitely my favorite. So many great games and great memories with the console.
2021-02-03 11:16:02,gaming,"Nope, sorry, you play one of the most toxic of toxic game communities. There is so much shitty jargon jammed into anything LoL players say, you need a wiki for 90% of anything in chat...  

...outside the curse words I mean.  


I don't believe you for a second."
2021-02-03 11:16:01,gaming,"Lots of people would probably love to see Rapture or Columbia (the settings from Bioshock 1/2 and Bioshock Infinite, respectively).

As for characters it's hard to go wrong with some of the classic gaming icons like Solid Snake (Metal Gear Solid), Ryu (Street Fighter) or Samus Aran (Metroid). Besides the obvious Mario or Link of course.

Me personally? Might be fun to see an Atelier protagonist. Any of them really but the most recent and honestly probably best known would be Ryza. Also something themed after a Yakuza character; I'd love to see Kazuma Kiryu's back tattoo on a candle."
2021-02-03 11:15:53,gaming,"Been looking at stuff like this for a while.....you my friend, have the best set up!!! Very nice and if I wasn‚Äôt poor I‚Äôd give you an award ü•á <<<<my free reward for you. Awesome bro!!"
2021-02-03 11:15:51,gaming,"Well, it's more like going from 1080P to 4k. 

a super ultrawide  5120 x 1440 moniter is 88% of the pixels of a 4k monitor.

an ultra wide 2560 x 1440 is only 44% of the pixels.

That's the cost difference there."

2021-02-03 11:15:48,gaming,"So modern warfare is amazing, but activision is doing weird things to roll it into cold war (which I do not recommend). I think modern warfare probably still has momentum behind it, but red dead is an epic single player campaign and has a good multiplayer that I think will be supported for a long time. Traditionally fps games fall off when new versions come out as the player base migrates, you might have a better experience overall with red dead"
2021-02-03 11:15:46,gaming,don't be ashamed of your accent. fuck anyone that makes fun of the way others speak.
2021-02-03 11:15:41,gaming,"Added, totally forgot about Payday!"
2021-02-03 11:15:40,gaming,Laptops were such plastic heaps of crap back then.
2021-02-03 11:15:38,gaming,"i understand why people love it, i just couldn't get into the game after trying multiple times. something about the combat always felt wrong to me. that and i'm not the biggest fan of skipping entries so maybe if i go back and play 1/2 some day."
2021-02-03 11:15:38,gaming,Biggest let down isnt cyberpunk is a big let down

2021-02-03 11:15:19,gaming,Is it safe to assume SNES is your favorite console? I see 3 different versions on display

That's a name I haven't heard for a long, long time."
2021-02-03 11:14:40,gaming,"I just started playing it today after hearing endless praise. So far it seems good but not quite as incredible as I've been led to believe, though I still need to play it more to really be able to judge it."
2021-02-03 11:14:35,gaming,Abed Pigeon: coo...coo coo coo.
2021-02-03 11:14:32,gaming,Then it becomes like the Esurance girl and they discontinue using the character.

2021-02-02 08:01:09,gaming,"I'm similar to you. For me, it wasn't a Zelda game. I actually enjoy linear, easy to follow, not-so-open world games. The shrines weren't really full fledged dungeons. The weapon system didn't bother me too  much, but it took some time to get the hand of it. It was just different than what I'm used to in a Zelda game, and, unfortunately, it missed the mark for me."
