2021-02-02 08:06:32,acotar,This is how I pronounce it as well.
2021-02-02 08:05:46,acotar,And I pronounce it that way cuz I can't take it seriously if his nickname is Rice lol.
2021-02-02 08:04:59,acotar,There's a pronunciation guide. It's confirmed it's supposed to be reese-and/Reese. :)
2021-02-02 07:30:45,acotar,"How many options did Hybern have? He needed a human to be the emissary to the queens - they wouldn't have trusted the fae. He also needed someone he could make a deal with, one that would guarantee cooperation. The world believed Jurian to be totally mad and hell bent on revenge against Myriam... and Hybern believed the cauldron would be able locate her.

Hybern could have easily killed Jurian after he resurrected him if he didn't think he would cooperate, but Jurian played the madman so convincingly that even his old friends believed him completely gone - so any potential risk would have been mitigated in Hybern's eyes."
2021-02-02 07:17:46,acotar,I’m pretty sure I remember in the books Jurian explained that they thought he’d gone crazy or something
2021-02-02 07:16:47,acotar,"You are literally describing yourself. My ""claims"" are not baseless and I have said multiple times that I understand why people want children and are happy with them.
 
You are trying to describe how I feel and acting like you know better than myself. Have a good day though I'm pretty sure arguing with a stranger on the Internet was the highlight of your boring life."
2021-02-02 07:14:28,acotar,"That is great possibility, that they will try since it would be unrealistic that fae take to long to get pregnant, but they're special and great pregnant on the first try. I'm still 100% certain SJM did this because she herself had a child."

2021-02-02 06:46:07,acotar,"I thought it was Rice-and. But Maas said it was Reese-and, ssssooooo. I still like Rice-and better, but what’re you gonna do. 

Imma need her to put phonetic spellings at the beginning of her books and not the end, tbh."
2021-02-02 06:44:07,acotar,Have you finished Acowar? I don’t wanna accidentally spoil things.
2021-02-02 06:40:11,acotar,"I have no idea why he was resurrected other than that he was an emissary for the human queens but for your other point why would he work with the King? Because the king promised to resurrect Myriam, other than that it is kinda vague, the king also wouldn’t see one human as a risk, even tho Jurian is the most underestimated and undervalued character in the series 🤗🌙"
2021-02-02 06:38:14,acotar,i think because the king assumed he had gone mad the only thing he would have wanted to do was have revenge against miryam and drakon. sooo maybe the king thought that if their forces were to ally with the humans jurian would fight with the king.
2021-02-02 06:29:41,acotar,Same!! Damn Sarah and her ambiguously pronounced names!!😂
2021-02-02 06:27:45,acotar,"My friend pronounces it ""Reese-land"". Granted we are both non-native speakers and reading in English so she gets a pass. I listened to the audio books and changed my pronunciation after it"
2021-02-02 06:25:55,acotar,Kal-ee-us
2021-02-02 06:25:04,acotar,"Yeah, same for me for both of those. Now I have a hard time imagining either name any other way."
2021-02-02 06:06:22,acotar,"I used to say Rice-and but Sarah pronounces it like Rhys-and. Sort of like Lucien, I pronounce it as Lu-see-un but Sarah pronounced it like Lush-ien."
2021-02-02 05:53:00,acotar,I'm sure there's something French in the way I hear it. Rhyssss-AHND
2021-02-02 05:40:53,acotar,"Kall ih ass, but thats because im german"
2021-02-02 05:37:47,acotar,"I think her fear wasn't him telling everyone, but he not accepting her because he really knows her and she loves him as she can"
2021-02-02 05:12:55,acotar,I’ve always said in my head “kuh-lee-is” 🤷🏻‍♀️
2021-02-02 05:12:51,acotar,I pronounced it kal-ay-s but I’m weird lol
2021-02-02 04:29:33,acotar,Kal-ee-us but that’s just me :)
2021-02-02 02:04:10,acotar,"You know what, that makes a LOT of sense. I too am not the a fan of Sarah making her characters the most powerful or the long list descendant of someone and Cassian simply being good because he honed his skills as you said would be a nice, normal change."
2021-02-02 01:57:22,acotar,"First, you said you didn’t like children in one of your post. Second, you said that children aren’t the ultimate happy ending. I’m disagreeing with you. I’m also pointing out that most people do like kids and do count having children as the ultimate happy ending. You seem to be ok with them being super in love in the matter of weeks, but not ok with your perceived “rushing” of having kids. Like I said before, the author knows more about her own characters mental states and what makes them happy. 

Also, gaslighting is a form of emotional abuse and not someone disagreeing with your own statements that you made on a public forum. Get off of Reddit that is an echo chamber for people who truly do not understand what that buzzword even means."
2021-02-02 01:34:51,acotar,Your problem is that you truly believe that most people aren’t happy with kids. Your the one with the super edgy post-not me. You aren’t used to people disagreeing with your baseless claims and it shows.
2021-02-02 00:07:02,acotar,"I love her. She gets a lot of hate with regards to the whole Azriel-Cassian triangle; but, in my opinion, she was in a bad spot looking for a way out and then became even better friends with them after it went down. So they all chose to be silent on the matter to keep the delicate balance in their group dynamic for the sake of the Inner Circle. I don’t think it’s fair when people point fingers at her as if the strong, capable, Illyrian warriors aren’t fully grown males making their own choices."
2021-02-01 22:56:37,acotar,this^^
2021-02-01 22:56:34,acotar,"He WENT FOR IT. Like, he could’ve just played one card, but he was like, “I’m gonna show you my whole sexy hand, because fuck it.”

My love language is words of affirmation, and literally all I want is to find someone who can tell me how much they want me. And this is... *****chef’s kiss*****"
2021-02-01 22:56:18,acotar,[deleted]
2021-02-01 20:55:15,acotar," Neither was I, but you learn some interesting things about other characters that made it worth it for me. You’ll be happy to have all the info and drama for the last book."
2021-02-01 20:50:59,acotar,"I have to be honest, but I don't think she is a well written character. Don't get me wrong, I think she had great potential; but I wasn't a fan of how she came out to Feyre in ACOWAR. I found that it didn't do justice to what Mor represented. It felt like a forced monologue that was thrown in for the sake of LGBTQ+ representation...I think it could've been written better..."
2021-02-01 20:40:08,acotar,"I'd have to politely disagree with you on this one. I feel like SJM always reveals that the beloved characters are these extremely powerful beings, and that their immense power was revealed through a twist, either by secret their parenthood where they have inherited power, or that they have receives new vast power. I don't necessarily have problem with reading characters with power, but I cant help feeling bored by the fact that these characters are portrayed as the MOST powerful of their specific type of magic, and typically, their powerful magic is tied by a secret lineage that  was revealed as a twist.

But what makes me cringe is that in  her series so far the main characters of the series are placed in these ultimate power couples that seem invisible in terms of the power they wield by the end.

I shall list the many examples of this,  so warning spoilers ahead for the other series...

***TOG:***

>!Aelin secretly being fae with immense fire magic; Dorian inheriting powerful raw magic from Elena that was also a twist; Yrene being the most powerful healer and favoured by Silba greatly, Manon being the secret last descendent of the Crochan witch royal line; Lysandra being a secret powerful shapeshifter....!<

>!POWERFUL COUPLES: Aelin/Rowan and Dorian/Manon...they are literally powerful royals with immense power!<

***CC:***

>!Bryce's secret that she has the starborn power as well as being the secret daughter of the Autumn King; Hunt as the most powerful angel and being known as the notorious 'Umbra Mortis'; Hypaxia being the secret witch queen as well an exceptional med witch!<

>!POWERFUL COUPLE: Bryce/Hunt... Bryce is the  most powerful current starborn and coupled with a recently free powerful archangel whose power is always coveted to be controlled...!<

 ;

***ACOTAR:***

*Feyre being extremely powerful and probably the most powerful fae as she possesses the power of ALL of the High Lords; Rhys being the MOST powerful High lord; Azriel being the notorious rare shadow singer; Amren being this enigma ancient powerful creature; Lucian being described as most likely to be more powerful than his brothers which is then implicitly explained that he is secretly Helion's heir; Nesta being alluded to process great power that is unknown*

*POWERFUL COUPLE: Feyre/Rhys....the most powerful high lord with the first and only high lady that possesses power from all other high lords*

 ;

 ;

From all the examples I've listed above, I feel like if Cassian's power is rooted from a secret powerful lineage, it'll be an arc that SJM has done multiple times in her series. I am content that Cassian is one of the few characters whose power is rooted just from honed skills that he obtained through discipline and dedication. I feel like it is more satisfying if Cassian was able to get rid of his insecurities of coming from a broken family instead of possibly releasing his insecurity by finding out that he actually came from a secret special family. I feel like his normal background is what makes him interesting, he literally had to work so hard to get where he is. I don't understand why he cannot come from humble beginnings and be a powerful Illyrian.

If he does end up having a secret parentage, I don't think I'd find it enjoyable to read as it is an arc I've seen numerous times from SJM. Also, I feel like ACOSL is going in a route where we find out what Nesta's power is, and I don't think I'd appreciate to read about another potential powerful couple of Nesta's secret archaic power and Cassian's Illyrian power from a secret lineage...this sounds a lot like...*TOG spoiler*: >!Dorian and Manon's relationship to me where Manon was a secret queen and Dorian suddenly gained raw magic!<to me."
2021-02-01 20:28:09,acotar,Throne of glass was definitely a commitment but it was worth every second! I would highly recommend I cried so hard in the last book lollllll
2021-02-01 20:25:24,acotar,Think they still sell it on Barnes and nobles but it’s out of stock last I checked. I bought the new covers and I’m so happy with them! But also like if u have all old covers it wouldn’t look right to have one new cover amongst them. Only issue is if you get a court of silver flames it matches the new covers and not the old!
2021-02-01 20:23:52,acotar,Ebay!! They have some listed.
2021-02-01 20:18:20,acotar,Ikrr
2021-02-01 20:16:12,acotar,"I like her and think she is the best for most people, but I absolutely hate how she treats Azriel. I feel like she could have told him everything a long time ago and he would have kept her secrets if she asked him to."
2021-02-01 20:10:09,acotar,"Imagine if they did get together in ACOSF. All that angst and tension built up, sizzling inside a beer can after Maas so happily shakes it, and we readers open it and boom"
2021-02-01 20:00:41,acotar," I agree :) she always has these bits of wisdom to end a conversation which lets u know how much she's been through and how she fought through it, but she can still be that friend who knows how to have a looot of fun"
2021-02-01 19:53:57,acotar,"Oh yeah, it was you who posted that! ☺️☺️ That was so spot-on."
2021-02-01 19:53:08,acotar,"Heeey yes this is beautiful. I read a caption to a fanart once which said ""our favorite gossip girl"" and that made me LOL"
2021-02-01 19:52:46,acotar,"Not sure if I picture helion like the dude you posted, but either way this guy is fine as helllll🥵 he gives me angsty chaol vibes or maybe Adrian ivashkov🔥"
2021-02-01 19:52:40,acotar,"I did one of Elain not too long ago!

I’m keeping my eye out for a Nesta, but haven’t seen any good contenders yet"
2021-02-01 19:51:41,acotar,"Yep, I like this. I remember she said she had a ""soft mouth"" but the upper part of this girl's face is kinda strong. :)

Someone crossposted a picture of who could be Elain and I also liked that. Nesta on the other hand is still beautiful and has the strongest, most fierce-looking features but I have yet to find a real-life woman who may look like her."
2021-02-01 19:45:52,acotar,I agree
2021-02-01 19:44:13,acotar,"If I could pick any character to meet irl, I would pick her. She has a way of making people feel…comfortable. Welcome."
2021-02-01 19:26:10,acotar,I got Night Court i'm a dreamer
2021-02-01 19:21:01,acotar,">!In Acofas you see that it wasn't a happy ending after all, the battle was won but everyone is very scarred and healing and it talks a lot about the in acofas.!<"
2021-02-01 19:09:36,acotar,Yes! For some reason I always pictures Varys from GOT... not hot though lol
2021-02-01 19:00:26,acotar,"Oh yeah, 21 seems SO young, especially when starting a COMPLETELY new life. But at the same time, they live in a medieval type time period, so having kids at 21 is probably pretty normal or even late. I'm still thinking it was mostly because SJM had babies on the brain!  I'm wondering if we're ever going to get to see her with a child, or if they'll just be ""trying"" for however many books there are left."
2021-02-01 18:57:06,acotar,shes so pretty wtf
2021-02-01 18:49:24,acotar,YES PLEASE!
2021-02-01 18:48:45,acotar,"Crashes in through the ceiling. 

Did someone say Helion book?"

2021-02-01 18:47:32,acotar,"I got mine at Barnes and nobles. But I’m guessing this means they no longer make it. 

Find any used bookstore. 

If you’re anywhere near Powell’s bookstore in Oregon, they’ll have it. That’s where I got my original print Reckless book."
2021-02-01 18:45:11,acotar,Yes. There was something else going on.
2021-02-01 18:44:29,acotar,🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌
2021-02-01 18:44:10,acotar,"WOW, THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY FOR NO REASON. She was literally just explaining that representation matters. If you are that upset by this than something else is going on. 🤔🤔"
2021-02-01 18:38:15,acotar,I also feeling youre just trying to gaslight me or you're not reading what I'm saying because it feels like we're having a different conversation.
2021-02-01 18:37:02,acotar,"Oh yea, definitely. I am certain Feyre has that fear and its one of the reasons why she says she is ready. As people have pointed out, wars are known to generate baby booms, which will surely happen here. SJM knew how to set it up, even Aelin's fall in KoA set it up nicely and I'm sure they will have a great family. 

It just bothered me that she is so young compared to how long fae live. She is literally 21, married to a 500 year old male. I understand that some are ready to have children at her age, but it just doesn't sit that well with me. Its just my opinion, but I do see your arguments and I understand them."
2021-02-01 18:31:39,acotar,"I never said I said facts. I specified multiple times that it is my own opinion. I said in the title and I've said MULTIPLE times that it is an opinion. Never once had I said the word fact. 

Do you disagree that some people are perfectly happy without having children? Just because you want children, doesn't mean everyone wants them."
2021-02-01 17:33:10,acotar,Underneath by Cobi for me. It gives otherworldly vibes.
2021-02-01 17:22:04,acotar,No way that there is Amren vibes for daaaaays 😆
2021-02-01 17:19:45,acotar,You’re on a roll today 🤪
2021-02-01 17:16:43,acotar,No problem. I think we both misunderstood each other.
2021-02-01 17:10:49,acotar,Calm down Eris 😂
2021-02-01 17:03:02,acotar,"I think part of this was because of SJM having a baby around this time, BUT I think she did an okay job of setting it up in the books. The part when Feyre is shopping for a solstice present and goes into the weaver's store. She hears the story about the Void and Hope tapestry and how the weaver's husband died in the war, before they could have children. The weaver didn't have any piece of her husband. I think that struck a chord with Feyre, especially since she DID lose Rhys (even for a few minutes). I think hearing the weaver's story scared her. So whether or not she is emotionally ready for children, who knows. But I think it definitely scared her into wanting to try sooner rather than later."
2021-02-01 16:52:58,acotar,"I apologize. I guess it feels uncomfortable being insinuated that someone might be racist. That’s how I felt simply because I posted a perfectly fine image of what I personally imagine when I read a book we all like.  Not ok to make anyone else feel that way even to make a point. I just wanna say living where I do, I love and embrace these kinds of dialogues on a daily basis. My poor reaction was after multiple times being told something I think or feel is wrong probably four different times by the same person and was not so much a reaction to the content of what she was saying.  I’ll take all the downvotes people want to throw me though.  Can’t even have a normal fun conversation these days without people trying to make it into something “wrong”"
2021-02-01 16:36:38,acotar,"I’m so glad I’m not the only one who cried 😂I just recently read this for the first time as well and it’s my favorite series, hands down!!"
2021-02-01 16:31:49,acotar,i’m pretty sure they would say the same about me
2021-02-01 16:30:50,acotar,"No I am not being racist. I sent this comment before I saw you responded to another one so I didn't see where whatever this is has been happening for months. I don't see every character as just one ethnicity either. I know the world has varied shades as I have eyes. As for Tarquin, he is one of the only actually dark skinned characters I think most people agree on. What I was worried about, before your other comment, was if you were they type of person who sees darker skin and goes ""ah so lightly sun-kissed"". I don't think that's the case anymore so I think we're good here. Also again I don't take kindly to being called racist especially since this is more of a colorism issue."
2021-02-01 16:29:55,acotar,Thank you! Either way I don’t really mind ☺️
2021-02-01 16:24:21,acotar,There literally is no conflict and you’re dragging this out and totally disregarding that I’ve said multiple times that that commenter has been rude multiple times and I was just kind of over her. Again please feel free to post your own images of what you want to see of characters. No one is stopping you. I also mentioned several times that I picture other characters in this book as black such as Tarquin.  Do you want every single character to be black?  There is a whole wild world of skin shades out there for us to enjoy.  What is so wrong with having some middle eastern type characters?  Are you racist against them?
2021-02-01 16:22:35,acotar,what an emotional roller coaster
2021-02-01 16:16:52,acotar,It was a much slower start than ACOTAR for sure but by the third I was highly invested 😍 going to pick up Crescent City next.
2021-02-01 16:16:38,acotar,"I think you're being a little rude to the person who commented about Helion being black. While I don't know if he was supposed to be black, I do feel like he is of darker skin than what you've shown. I know we all have different images of what characters look like in our heads, but when I read that a character has dark skin than see that the darkest people's minds can think of is tan... it feels weird. I understand seeing him as Egyptian because of the sun and him being high lord of day it make sense. The problem is that for some people of color it feels like people don't want or ignore the potential for darker skin to be an option and that feels personal. I don't think she's trying to be ugly with you I think she's just upset. Honestly you disregarding her concern and acting like she's attacking you is causing an unnecessary conflict."
2021-02-01 16:13:18,acotar,I’ll have to disagree with you on many of your points because like a lot of your facts-they are opinions. Having a child is many people’s ultimate happiness. And yes it can be someone’s ultimate happy ending. Acting like a few people on Reddit agree with you about that fact doesn’t give you much in terms of “rightness”
2021-02-01 16:09:47,acotar,"I live in a predominantly black city and have quite a few biracial friends and it’s fairly obvious.  In my mind I just didn’t see Lucien as being biracial to that extent but again, we are all allowed to see the characters how we like.  I don’t view all of the characters as white pale ghost people. My reaction to her comment was probably extreme but she’s been getting on my nerves for several months based on her rude replies to many of my comments and general conversations with other people in this group.  If it had been anyone else or probably would have turned into a really cool conversation.  Also I appreciate your point of view 100%."
2021-02-01 16:06:05,acotar,"Yes! To add a little fuel to that fire, when Rhys and Feyre are in the library, they say:

""Humans don't have magic."" (Feyre)

""Some do. Usually those with distant Fae ancestry."" (Rhys)

They then go on to talk about what happened to the half fae offspring. I think it could definitely hint to Nesta's true nature and why she wasn't affected by Tamlin's glamour. Sarah never puts anything in her books that doesn't directly affect the storyline and this little convo really popped out at me because it didn't seem to have much to do with what was going on at the time.

Also to take it a step further, the Bone Carver also talked about a female fae warrior who trapped all of the death gods. Many people think Nesta stole some death magic from the cauldron. Perhaps she is somehow related to this ancient Fae warrior. Nothing the Carver has ever said or done is coincidence. He schemes and crafts everything carefully. So I think these two instances also point to her being part of some ancient Fae bloodline"
2021-02-01 16:04:52,acotar,"I don't think you are aware, but biracial people come in different colors. It's possible for people to be half black and not look it. This person probably just feels the Helion should be dark skinned that the picture you shared. As a black woman and fan of the series I also get a little uncomfortable when fans show pictures of people they think fit the characters and they're all light skinned."
2021-02-01 16:01:56,acotar,Haha I love this.  I can’t picture Mor getting down with Santa. But now I’m trying to 🤔
2021-02-01 15:59:16,acotar,"I always imagined him as more of a round man...like...a hot, bearded Santa-like man vs him being so chiseled. Maybe it was his booming laughter or something? Idk. He’s bear-like in my mind."
2021-02-01 15:59:14,acotar,"To Helion, Cassian, Azriel, Lucien, Rhysand - 🖕🏻👋🏻"
2021-02-01 15:38:08,acotar,Mor’s father just LAUGHS at Feyre when she asks for the mirror.  Consider it a wedding gift he laughs.  But one would wonder what goes through his mind when he discovers it’s gone. If he realizes Feyre looked into it and lived to take it away.  You would think he would never mess with Feyre again.
2021-02-01 15:35:47,acotar,You guys are so adorable and yes it’s so hard not to be able to get with friends in person this last year to talk about books. Reddit has been my “book club” for the year haha.  There is a fan art that totally makes me cry for the Suriel every time I see it.

2021-02-01 15:31:00,acotar,I know what a jerk!! And then he has the gall to blame Feyre for his people leaving him.  Uhhh she may have helped it along but you did some pretty rotten stuff alllllll by yourself buddy.
2021-02-01 15:24:22,acotar,"Ha! I remember reading Tower of Dawn when that came out and I wasn’t aware that it was going to be about Chaol. I was SO ANGRY when I kept reading and reading and saying hey where is Aelin?? I finally realized that this book wasn’t going to be about Aelin and just kept reading.  I read it a second time later and it really hit me how even though I couldn’t give a care for Chaol, that his story was actually beautiful and beautifully written."
2021-02-01 15:20:04,acotar,Omg I had no idea. What an incredibly fantastic book for someone that young. Those books are my favorite. I have to say more so than ACOTAR
2021-02-01 15:17:37,acotar,Yes and it’s during that time that the Rite happens I believe.  When the three stars are visible.
2021-02-01 15:02:41,acotar,"Someone mentioned above that there are a lot of different ethnicities that identify as POC and that is true.  Native Americans and many of my Hispanic friends identify as POC.  All that aside, don’t let anyone discourage you from enjoying your own imagination. That’s the beauty of books. It allows you to let the words create your own imagery on a unique blank palette. Also I wouldn’t be surprised if more people imagined something similar to you.  He was popular in Greece and Persia. Also Helios was described as a God who “gives joy to Mortals” so right on for having a crush on him."

Not as smutty but still good is the Kingdom of Runes series (one more book to come in that series). Book 1 and 2 could've just been one book in my opinion, and things really pick up and get interesting in book 3. But you have to read 1 and 2 for important character background."

SJM apparently really liked S&amp;D, I thought it fell flat and the romance didn't seem logical or natural, so I haven't read the second book. 

ACOMAF is also my absolute favorite in the series! My husband has agreed to read the series and is dragging through book 1 (only at the point where Feyre went back home) and I just keep telling him to wait for the second half!"
