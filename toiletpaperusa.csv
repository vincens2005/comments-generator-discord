2021-02-03 11:17:39,ToiletPaperUSA,"Dear **Weather Girls**,      

You claim that it is **raining men**, but yet rain is the result of **water vapor** condensing in the atmosphere, and it is literally impossible for **men** to condense like **water**.       

If this did happen, the **men** would all **violently die on impact**, traumatizing many innocent people. Why, then, would you proclaim ""**hallelujah it's raining men**"", unless you want **all men to die?**     

Curious."
2021-02-03 11:17:36,ToiletPaperUSA,"Yeah this is the thing about 4chan a lot of people assume its all just hate and racist shit and all that (and yeah nowadays there is tbh) but theres also a lot of left leaning people on 4chan. I don't go on there tons nowadays but theres a few boards I look at and I've noticed whenever someone posts some racist bullshit or whatever other people are always like ""go back to pol"" and shit like that lol"
2021-02-03 11:14:12,ToiletPaperUSA,You got his fans super emotional.

2021-02-02 08:25:50,ToiletPaperUSA,Steven Crowder is a failed theater kid who is taking his rage out on everyone who was mean to him from the ages of 5 to now.
2021-02-02 08:25:39,ToiletPaperUSA,"Wait, THIS is the asshole my little sister keeps talking about?

I'm gonna have to have words with her."

2021-02-02 08:24:26,ToiletPaperUSA,Bold of Steven to assume anyone wants to be his friend.
2021-02-02 08:24:20,ToiletPaperUSA,I was going with problems chronologically lol.
2021-02-02 08:22:57,ToiletPaperUSA,"I was talking to a conservative once about raising the minimum wage and they were like ""why don't they just unionize."" Meanwhile this person probably voted for Reagan as he proceeded to gut unions."

2021-02-02 08:21:07,ToiletPaperUSA,"What of it doesn’t make sense? Of course it’s not that simplified since equilibrium is always moving in the real life, but it is how our market works.

Here’s a good explanation."
2021-02-02 08:20:51,ToiletPaperUSA,"I personally agree with you. The edgy seems to come up when someone asks,""why do you need so many guns?"" Perhaps its not edgy and is more a hill to stand on, but for my cousin, its one of the only times he has ever gotten excited about much of anything."
2021-02-02 08:20:05,ToiletPaperUSA,What’s the original quote?
2021-02-02 08:19:48,ToiletPaperUSA,[removed]
2021-02-02 08:19:25,ToiletPaperUSA,"In theory parliament serve as an advisor to the Queen. She has to approve any bill from parliament and she's the one who officially chooses Prime Minister. But the last time monarch vetoed parliament bill was in 1708 and since 1902 Prime Minister was always an MP from House of Commons, so basically elected."
2021-02-02 08:19:15,ToiletPaperUSA,"My school stopped the pledge in 7th grade. Obviously we thought it was something normal then but in hindsight it really makes me cringe. You're basically programming kids to robotically make this pledge to unquestionably give their allegiance to the country when they haven't even had the time to think for themselves about all its virtues and vices. And consequently, that ""my country, right or wrong"" mentality is easy to foster."
2021-02-02 08:19:01,ToiletPaperUSA,No problem
2021-02-02 08:18:54,ToiletPaperUSA,"No need to convince me, I already know. It's people like Stephen Crowder that use the evil actions of some governments to maliciously smear an entire religious community."
2021-02-02 08:18:50,ToiletPaperUSA,"are you fucking stupid, like genuinely"
2021-02-02 08:18:42,ToiletPaperUSA,Thanks for explaining this. It helps with my brother
2021-02-02 08:18:36,ToiletPaperUSA,lot of cringe takes here
2021-02-02 08:17:29,ToiletPaperUSA,"Yes, indeed.

I was making an off color joke."
2021-02-02 08:17:23,ToiletPaperUSA,Because he’s a sniveling coward like his idol scump
2021-02-02 08:17:13,ToiletPaperUSA,If we learned anything from Trump it's that keeping shit simple and using hypnotic patterns will lull your audience into a false sense of security.
2021-02-02 08:16:43,ToiletPaperUSA,"You're not wrong, but IMO Crossfit is like a scientology of fitness."
2021-02-02 08:16:06,ToiletPaperUSA,Yea my mind changed when I started to look up gender studies and gender fluidity. It made me realise that what other people do has no effect on my life.
2021-02-02 08:15:43,ToiletPaperUSA,"If you side with fascists and neo nazis, were not friends."
2021-02-02 08:14:51,ToiletPaperUSA,Well well well... if it isn't the consequences of my own actions.
2021-02-02 08:14:41,ToiletPaperUSA,"Same with me. The appearance eroded the moment I watched their left counterparts go line by line about how what they say is wrong. Never saw these right youtube personalities ever do such a thing in a significant way. Once you have someone point out all the BS it makes you realize how they’re just harping the same few points, blaming mainstream media, and creating the illusion that “annoying gender studies SJWs” are a monolithic majority of liberals when in reality they’re a blip."
2021-02-02 08:14:41,ToiletPaperUSA,"Why can’t we at least try to help them? It all stems from a lack of education, so instead of saying that these HUMAN people should die, why not advocate for a better education system which helps people see things from the point of view of others?

I get it, I also used to want to kick everyone who voted for Trump in the balls, but the old generation is almost gone. We can start making improvements as soon as we want to"
2021-02-02 08:14:02,ToiletPaperUSA,With a fucking gun in the thumbnail.
2021-02-02 08:13:51,ToiletPaperUSA,It's edited. They enlarged it slightly.

2021-02-02 08:11:35,ToiletPaperUSA,"I'm not Libertarian, but I see it more as an ideological compromise between left and right. It's just the extreme Libertarians who want to abolish the DMV that I can't take seriously."

Now I make it my mission to research the fuck out of everything. So I think they target people who know nothing about politics and only teach them that they are correct as right wing"
2021-02-02 08:07:57,ToiletPaperUSA,Probably worried that his phone got flagged by the stingrays in the Capitol building.
2021-02-02 08:07:43,ToiletPaperUSA,This is the way.
2021-02-02 08:06:37,ToiletPaperUSA,Feels like a missed opportunity not using the Charles T Kirkland template
2021-02-02 08:06:04,ToiletPaperUSA,"I *know* about the cult-like behavior, but is it regional?  Kids in my area are surrounded by liberal ideals enough that they know the world isn't villainizing them for being white. 

What areas/regions/etc is it both edgy to be conservative but you're not shown clearly enough about the liberal side to realize it's all bullshit?  I figured ""edgy"" means your parents are not that... what liberal parents lets their kids believe they're terrible for being white?  Even the name and advertized beliefs seem stodgy.  ""We're the law and order people""... so edgy!"
2021-02-02 08:06:02,ToiletPaperUSA,It’s a “News” Network for people who think Fox News is not fascist enough...
2021-02-02 08:05:52,ToiletPaperUSA,">shitting on other cultures for what they eat is incredibly bigoted.

Murdering defenseless animals capable of suffering for no other reason than ""I enjoy it"" is reprehensible. It's not bigoted to apply this standard across all cultures, you stupid, dense fuck. This is either transparently disingenuous or you're the dumbest person I've spoken to in the last month."
2021-02-02 08:05:09,ToiletPaperUSA,Or like... racism?
2021-02-02 08:04:30,ToiletPaperUSA,"Yep, the air traffic controllers union supported Reagan in the 1980 election, with Reagan heavily pandering to them and their membership voted heavily in support of him.  Reagan then broke their strike, promptly fired them all and decertified their union."
2021-02-02 08:03:29,ToiletPaperUSA,"I think it’s okay to humanely raise animals for consumption. There’s a difference, and shitting on other cultures for what they eat is incredibly bigoted."
2021-02-02 08:03:28,ToiletPaperUSA,Steven Crowder is a pussy. The conservative mindset is based in fear. This loser is afraid of everything.
2021-02-02 08:02:51,ToiletPaperUSA,Their comedy is just racist jokes and being a bully which naturally gives them a massive conservative audience as long as they say the talking points from rush
2021-02-02 08:02:29,ToiletPaperUSA,"Well, thanks for letting me know I should drop the conversation here, because I've been wasting my time on a selfish sociopath who thinks it's okay to mass-murder dogs for their meat.

Ethically consistent? Sure. Fucking repugnant? Yes."

2021-02-02 08:01:25,ToiletPaperUSA,"If you just label Nazis as subhuman, aren’t doing anything to fight their online pipeline. Most closet fascists/Nazis deny that Nazis even exist anymore, and by saying that Nazis are less than human you are trying to imply that normal person couldn’t become one."
2021-02-02 08:01:03,ToiletPaperUSA,Hey now. Every fitness regimen is basically a cult.
2021-02-02 08:00:50,ToiletPaperUSA,"Honestly, if dogs are raised humanely to be killed, I don’t see a problem with using them as meat."
2021-02-02 08:00:30,ToiletPaperUSA,Is that like OnlyFans?
2021-02-02 07:59:32,ToiletPaperUSA,"She doesn't like politicians who lose gracefully.

She likes politicians who incite insurrections to overturn elections they lost."
2021-02-02 07:58:36,ToiletPaperUSA,Because it’s easy to blame their failures on “progressive”

Oh my god I looked it up on her Twitter and it is. This is a real human."
2021-02-02 07:55:01,ToiletPaperUSA,Imagine being this petty that you would tweet something like that. Pathetic. I'm sure he's getting celebrated in the replies as well.
2021-02-02 07:54:59,ToiletPaperUSA,If we can’t pollute until the rivers catch fire we’ll have to get rid of our toxic waste some more expensive way!  Environmental regulation destroys jobs!
2021-02-02 07:54:54,ToiletPaperUSA,"So I was the same as op but I never liked trump I was convinced he was the lesser of 2 evils. Currently I'd say I'm left leaning but back then in 2016/17/18 I was watching crowder. Its not the politics that attracts people, they come off as if they know better or are smart. That's what attracts people, they want to feel smart.

Furthermore, we were only shown the videos of people blaming men and white people for everything, these youtubers would make you feel like they are the only people who won't demonise you. At the time all I saw from these right wing channels is how the left want to blame white people and men on every issue in the world, it made you feel alone and hated. Then these people would make videos about how you weren't the enemy and it made you feel welcome.

Now I understand that they are counts who prey on teenage boys and their fears. I realised that people being gender fluid had no impact on me and that no one was actually making white people the enemy."
2021-02-02 07:53:46,ToiletPaperUSA,Yup. My bad

2021-02-02 07:53:16,ToiletPaperUSA,"There are plenty of these guys in Canada. We are not immune to sheltered, privileged suburban white boys who cannot empathize with hardships because they never experienced any.

That's not to say that all sheltered, privileged suburban white boys lack empathy btw. Just that empathy is less prominent in such an environment where development of it isn't a requirement (as it is for poor folks or minorities)."
2021-02-02 07:51:15,ToiletPaperUSA,Yes. What kind of fucking question is that? Sentient and smart are 2 different and separate things.
2021-02-02 07:51:00,ToiletPaperUSA,"Today I learned I’m actually agender, every day’s a school day!"
2021-02-02 07:49:10,ToiletPaperUSA,Sure... but he said he was being *edgy*.  I've met a few people (who wouldn't talk to me about it) with upper-middle-class Urban Democrat parents who were edgy conservatives.  I guess that's what I thought he was representing himself as.  It's not edgy to listen to Bieber ;)

2021-02-02 07:47:47,ToiletPaperUSA,"But, I'm not sure how that's edgy.  It's more of a ""fitting in"" thing for people in rural America.  It's not like the Democratic Party's gun policy doesn't match the policies held by the NRA until the 70's.  I know that people will blindly follow something, but u/TopSneek seems to have been thoughtful enough to care about ""good conservative policy"" back then."
2021-02-02 07:47:35,ToiletPaperUSA,"Read Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad.

Or read some Jung in reference to the shadow.

It's important to acknowledge that every single person is capable of untold evils. Also important to acknowledge that nurture >>>> nature in most things. These racist pricks ARE human and if we want to prevent more racists we need to figure out how they got this way and how we can change the environment (culture) to prevent more of them."
2021-02-02 07:47:34,ToiletPaperUSA,Because he supported it.
2021-02-02 07:46:59,ToiletPaperUSA,I think hes a closeted homosexual himself and uses his joking as a mask.

2021-02-02 07:44:14,ToiletPaperUSA,"I am not sure what it was that drove the person you asked, but for my cousin, it is gun rights. He is a single issue voter and beyond the gun rights it doesnt make any sense to be conservative. His brother married a mexican woman, his cousin is black and his sister is building up the courage to come out to her family. He is so obsessed with people taking his guns,(he has a LOT of them) and taking away his hunting rights that he will drink any koolaid that is set in front of him. The pro gun culture can be very radical and gets very edgy. The willingness to fight the establishment appeals very much to teens."
2021-02-02 07:44:01,ToiletPaperUSA,"People like Charlie and TPUSA (you may have heard of them lol) have tried to paint conservatism as a counter-culture movement to teens. ""Look at how everything you see in the media is so librul, you know what would really stick it to the man? Going against the grain and backing Trump because he doesn't play by the rules. You'll really make all those girls at your high school/college mad by supporting conservatives and that makes you a rebel.""

99% of kids at that age dont really understand how the world works or are seriously knowledgeable about US history and politics, so it's easy to trick a lot of them into buying into their shit. Kids dont have the background knowledge to understand they've used similar tactics and have had the same agenda for decades, or understand how horrible conservative policies are across the board. I fell for right wing conspiracy theories pretty hard at like 18/19 because of this and had to slowly work my way out of it through education and real-life experience, so I have some firsthand experience with how they suck gullible people in."
